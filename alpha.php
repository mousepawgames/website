				<p class="txtReg">We are looking for adventurous families 
				and educators to help us make Operation SpyRat totally 
				awesome! As a member of the ALPHA Program, you will get 
				to play and provide feedback on the game while it is in 
				development. This is valuable information that we use to 
				improve Operation SpyRat before its final release.</p>
				
				<p class="txtHead2">What is ALPHA?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">When a program is in ALPHA, that means 
				it is incomplete. It doesn't have all the features and 
				content that will appear in the final product, and it 
				usually has bugs and glitches.</p>
				
				<p class="txtReg">The whole purpose of ALPHA testing is 
				to find these problems, so they can be resolved. In addition, 
				since the software is early in the development process, 
				user feedback has a significant impact on the finished product.</p>
				
				<p class="txtHead2">Program Benefits</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Here are just some of the advantages 
				you have as an ALPHA Program participant:</p>
				<p class="txtReg"><ul class="list">
					<li>Play the game before anyone else!</li>
					<li>Provide valuable feedback that affects the game's features, interface, and content.</li>
					<li>Recieve an exclusive significant discount on the finished game.</li>
					<li>Have your name (or the name of your school) appear in the game credits! (Optional)</li>
				</ul></p>
				
				<p class="txtHead2">Obligations</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Here's what you would do:</p>
				<p class="txtReg"><ul class="list">
					<li>Play the provided portions of the game when they arrive in your email.</li>
					<li>Complete the simple questionnaire for each portion in the given timeframe.</li>
					<li>Comply with program regulations (including not sharing 
					game info or screenshots without permission.)</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p class="txtReg"></p>
				<p class="txtHead2">Eligibility</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Participation in the ALPHA Program must 
				be registered in the name of one individual, usually a 
				parent or teacher, who bears the legal responsibility to 
				oversee and ensure their group's compliance with ALPHA 
				Program rules. This individual must...</p>
				<p class="txtReg"><ul class="list">

				<p class="txtReg">Eligibility and program admission is

				reserves the right to terminate ALPHA Program membership 
				at any time, and for any reason.</p>
