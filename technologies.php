				<a href="http://opensource.org/" target=_blank><img class="characterLeft" width=200 src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/opensource-logos/osi_standard_logo.png"/></a>
				<p class="txtReg">Good ideas become great when we collaborate. The open source community is built around that notion. By freely sharing ideas, creations, and code, we can make a better world for everyone – a world driven by innovation, and not by greed.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Many of our projects are open-source, and we are dedicated to promoting and contributing to this important revolution through our support of the <b><a href="http://opensource.org/" target=_blank>Open Source Initiative</a></b> and the projects that associate with it.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Our company is fueled by open-source software! Check out the projects we use, and consider helping them stay alive and growing. Promoting these projects, contributing your knowledge and skills to them, and if possible, donating to them, helps keep this dream alive.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Check out the following projects, all of which have become an essential part of MousePaw Games!</p>

							<p class="txtReg">For rapid application development, nothing beats Python. For programming in Python, nothing beats NINJA-IDE. Hailed by Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald as “the single best IDE in the history of computing,” NINJA-IDE offers superb error and standard-style checking as you write, and ensures all of your code works in both Python 2 and Python 3. The only downside is that NINJA-IDE isn't available for other programming languages.</p>

							<img class="photoCenter" width=200 src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/opensource-logos/geany.png", alt="Geany"/>
							<p class="txtReg">We use Geany first-and-foremost as our web editor, because of its superb HTML, CSS, and XML support. That said, Geany is a fantastic multi-language editor, supporting dozens of formats. It is designed to automate many common coding tasks, and boasts superb code completion.</p>

							<img class="photoCenter" width=200 src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/opensource-logos/blender.png", alt="Blender"/>
							<p class="txtReg">Working in 3D design has almost always meant paying for feature-heavy software costing in the thousands. Blender seeks to change all that by offering studio-quality CGI tools in an open-source software package. Some pretty impressive stuff has been created with it, including three award-winning short films.</p>

							<p class="txtReg">When it comes to editing audio, Audacity has long been regarded as one of the best.

							<p class="txtReg">Running in Linux is fantastic, but every so often, we need the operating system from those other guys too, especially when it comes to testing. This is where VirtualBox comes in handy. A free and open-source project managed by Oracle, VirtualBox makes it easy to run any operating system inside of another, as well as to control every aspect of the virtual system. Enough said.</p>
