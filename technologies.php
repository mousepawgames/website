			<p class="txtReg">
				Good ideas become great when we collaborate. The open
				source community is built around that notion. By freely
				sharing ideas, creations, and code, we can make a better
				world for everyone – a world driven by innovation, and
				not by profit.
			</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				Many of our projects are open-source, and we are
				dedicated to promoting and contributing to this
				important revolution through our support of the
				<b><a href="http://opensource.org/" target=_blank>
					Open Source Initiative
				</a></b> and the projects that associate with it.
			</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				Our company is fueled by open-source software! Check
				out the projects we use, and consider helping them
				stay alive and growing. Promoting these projects,
				contributing your knowledge and skills to them, and if
				possible, donating to them, helps keep this dream alive.

						as you write, and ensures all of your code works
						in both Python 2 and Python 3. The only downside

                        The build-in Git integration makes keeping track of
                        changes easy, and the hackable-to-the-core interface
                        means that each programmer can customize it to his or
