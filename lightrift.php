							<p class="txtHead1">Lightrift: Get in the driver's seat!</p>
							<p class="txtReg">It's your project. You know where you want to go with it, how it should look, and what platforms it should run on. Why should a big company tell you what you can do?</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Interactive animation reinvented.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Lightrift uses the <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/projects/anari">Anari Graphics Engine</a> to deliver high-quality, high-performance animation, even on machines with limited system resources. Plus, Lightrift provides full scripting and user-interaction features via <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/projects/ratscript">Ratscript</a>.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Freedom is yours.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Lightrift is open source, meaning that YOU set the course for your own project! No more paying monthly fees to work on your project, only to be forced into using methods and platforms that Big Old Corporation tells you to use. Your project, your way.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Cross-platform creativity.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Lightrift is built using standard open source technologies, including Gtk+3 and Cairo, so it works out of the box on Windows, Mac, and Linux! Lightrift projects are designed to run via a custom-built projection frame, so you can focus on delivering high-quality content to your users instead of building binaries. And, since we're open source, you can help expand our platform reach!</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Lightrift is Ideal For:</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Rapidly creating 2D games,</li>
								<li>Quality animations without exporting to video,</li>
								<li>Custom interactive content,</li>
							</ul>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead2">When will Lightrift be available?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Lightrift is presently in development, with no set release date. You can find out how get involved in the project <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/opensource">here.</a></p>
							<p class="txtHead2">So, Lightrift is free?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Lightrift is open source via the GPLv3 license, meaning that it can be used, studied, and modified by any individual or open-source project. If you want to use it in a closed-source project, you'll have to pay us. (Prices TBD).</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Is this a fork of Synfig Studio?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Not precicely, no. Lightrift is designed for game development, while Synfig Studio is for cinematic animation. We aim to cooperate with them to promote and improve both projects, as there is a lot of overlap!</p>
