				<p class="txtReg">
					MousePaw Games believes that the best ideas are 
					worth sharing. That is why we've decided make many
					of our core technologies open source!
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					This means that individuals, educators, students,
					and open-source software projects can use our
					code and technology completely free! Everyone is
					free to read, modify, use, and share our work.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					We welcome you to take part in our development
					process through experimenting, testing, reporting
					bugs, and contributing ideas and code.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					We maintain mirrors of our repositories on Github. 
					<a href="#contribute">Click here</a> for 
					information on how to get started.
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="txtHead2">What in the world is open source?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Open source is a software distribution model that
					promotes the free and unrestricted use, sharing,
					and modification of computer code. More information
					can be found at <a href="http://www.opensource.org">
					the Open Source Initiative website</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">What license(s) do you use?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Our projects are generally licensed under the
					<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"
					target=_blank>GPLv3</a> or, in some cases, the
					<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html"
					target=_blank>LGPLv3</a>. An additional non-free
					license will be offered for GPL'd code for anyone
					who wishes to use our projects in a closed-source
					project.
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">Why this licensing setup?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					We are strong proponents of the Open Source movement
					(contrasted with the Free Software movement.) However,
					we believe that our development staff deserves to
					get paid a living wage down the road (once we start
					selling stuff.) Thus, if someone else wants to
					profit from the fruits of their labors without
					also sharing in kind, our developers deserve
					a piece of that pie.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					It is worth noting that a part of those profits
					are also earmarked for supporting open-source
					software projects that we use.
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">I'm confused...</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					You may view, modify, share, or use part or all
					of the code in our open-source projects for free
					in virtually every situation you can think of, even
					if your own project is commercial (you're selling
					it) or if you don't want to share your own code.
					The only situation under which you need to pay us
					is if your project is BOTH <b>closed-source</b> AND
					<b>not free.</b>
				</p>
				<a name="contribute"/>
				<p class="txtHead2">Are all your projects open source?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Sorry, no. When it comes to certain projects,
					such as Operation SpyRat, open source is not a
					practical approach - not because the code is so
					top secret, but because the graphics and content
					are worth protecting!
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">I don't see [INSERT PROJECT] on Github!</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					We're in the process of getting our core projects
					ready for open sourcing. Stay tuned, we promise
					they're coming. Subscribe to 
					<a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/enews/">
						PawNews
					</a>
					to get notified when we do!
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">What's with the Terms of Development?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					That's to save everyone a few dozen headaches. If
					we realize later that we need to license a project
					under different terms, we don't want to try and 
					track down a few hundred people.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Besides that, it simply states that your code is
					licensed to us under the MIT License, unless you
					select another non-restrictive open source license
					that is compatible with GPL.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Third, it holds us accountable - as long as we're
					using your code, the project you contributed to
					shall have an open-source license.
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="txtHead2">How do I contribute code?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					<ol>
						<li>
							Obtain a copy of the project code from
							<a href="https://github.com/mousepawgames" target=_blank>
								Github
							</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make your changes to the code. Keep a single 
							patch as simple as possible. We review every 
							change manually. We're more likely to 
							accept smaller changes than larger ones. 
							(That said, if you're adding some massive 
							new feature, a large contribution may be 
							unavoidable.)
						</li>
						<li>
							Be sure to comment heavily and include a
							CHANGELOG, as it speeds up the review
							process. Also, include your real name.
						</li>
						<li>
							Export your changes to a patch file. We are
							unlikely to accept pull requests on Github.
						</li>
						<li>
							Email your patch file to us. By submitting
							code, you are agreeing to the 
							<a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/termsofdevelopment"
							target=_blank>
							Terms of Development</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							We will review your contribution. If we
							choose to use any part of it, your name
							will be added to the list of contributors.
						</li>
					</ol>
