				<p class="txtHead2">Why Internships?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					We like working with interns for two reasons: one, 
					because they are much more willing to learn and try 
					new things, and two, because they bring a lot of 
					out-of-the-box ideas to the company. We're having 
					to blaze a brand new trail. Experience can be 
					gained, but daring creativity is much harder to 
					come by. By and large, the only way into MousePaw 
					Games is through the internship program.
				</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">Compensation</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					MousePaw Games is a startup company. Since we are 
					working on our first product, no one is getting 
					paychecks just yet. However, we recognize that 
					your time and talent are valuable, and as such, 
					we believe that all interns are entitled to 
					compensation.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Your time logged during the internship will be 
					credited to you as an investment in the company, 
					at the rate of $10 an hour. These are actual 
					shares in our company, which will continue to 
					pay dividends to you for the life of the company. 
					We are not, and will never be, publicly traded, 
					so your investment is safe.
