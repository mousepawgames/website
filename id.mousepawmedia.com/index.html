                    Your MousePaw ID is your key to all MousePaw Media
                    development and collaboration tools. It provides access to
                    Phabricator, Nextcloud, and Jenkins.

                <p class=center>
                    MousePaw IDs are issued for staff, interns
                    (including community interns), and high-impact volunteers.

                <h1>FAQs</h1>
                <h3>Do I need a MousePaw ID for Phabricator?</h3>
                <p class=center>
                    If you just want to access Phabricator as a volunteer,
                    you can log in with a GitHub account instead.
                </p>
                <h3>Do I qualify for a MousePaw ID?</h3>
                <p class=center>
                    All interns, including community interns, are automatically
                    issued MousePaw IDs. Internship graduates ordinarily retain
                    their MousePaw IDs.
                </p>
                <p class=center>
                    If you regularly make quality contributions to MousePaw
                    Media projects as a volunteer, and you need access to our
                    CI pipeline and/or our planning tools, you can request
                    a MousePaw ID by contacting <span class=email>
                        developers@<span>null</span>mousepawmedia.com
                    </span>
                </p>
                <h3>Can I change my MousePaw ID password?</h3>
                <p class=center>
                    Because of the way the MousePaw ID system is built, it is
                    not currently possible (or practical) for you to set your
                    own password. You'll be issued a randomly generated
                    passphrase when your MousePaw ID is created. If you'd like
                    a new passphrase, just contact us. (We take steps to
                    verify it's you.)
                </p>
                <h3>I believe my MousePaw ID is compromised.</h3>
                <p class=center>
                    If at any time you suspect that someone has your
                    MousePaw ID credentials, please contact us right away!
                    We can take immediate steps to change your password or
                    lock down your MousePaw ID.
                </p>
                <h3>Someone at MousePaw Media asked for my ID. Do I give it?</h3>
                <p class=center>
                    No! Our IT department has processes in place if it becomes
                    necessary to access accounts linked to your MousePaw ID.
                    We will <em>never</em> ask for your MousePaw ID under any
                    circumstances. If you have been asked to provide this
                    information, it's a phishing scheme, and should be reported
                    to us immediately.
