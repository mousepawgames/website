				<p class="txtHead2">FREE One Year License!</p>
				<img class="characterRight" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/aliciabeta.gif" width=300px/>
				<p class="txtReg">We invite you to be a part of MousePaw Games' commitment to quality, and get a <b>free copy</b> of our most recent game - one free year for schools, and one free perpetual license for home users.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">We're looking for parents and teachers to help us improve our games through their participation in this 100% free, no risk program.</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">What is BETA?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">BETA means that the game is complete, but may have some undiscovered glitches, errors, and omissions.</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">Why Do We Do This?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">We want to make sure that our products meet the needs of our users, and there is no better way than to give the user the final word! Participants in the BETA program provide us valuable information that we use to improve our products - information about additional needs, glitches, errors, and omissions in content, and even feature requests!</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">What's In it For Me?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">How does a <b>free one year license</b> sound? We're not kidding. There are no purchase requirements, no hidden conditions, no surprise fees. This program is 100% free! Your only obligation is to provide us with the usage data we need. That's it!</p>
				<img class="characterLeft" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/rebekahbeta.gif" width=300px/>
				<p class="txtHead2">What Will I Do?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Every month, you will fill out a brief survey detailing your usage of the game, problems you've found, and any additional input you want to provide. You will also have access to a free online tester community, where you can discuss problems and feature suggestions with other users and directly with the MousePaw Games developers.</p>
				<p class="txtHead2">What if I Don't Like Glitches?</p>
				<p class="txtReg">BETA testing is not right for everyone, but we're also looking for teachers who are willing to provide us with anonymous data throughout the school year, as a part of our testing control group. In gratitude, we will give you a free copy of the finished game when it releases!</p>
