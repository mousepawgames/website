							<p class="txtReg">You may already be familiar with Redstring 1.1, which allowed for the rapid creation of repetative strings of text, not least of all being computer code. So, you may also be aware of all the problems that version had, including its consistant unresponsiveness while working on a long process.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Redstring 2.0 fixes all of that. Built in Python 2.7 and GTK+ 3, this new version is cleaner and far more intuitive than its older cousin. The renovated compile screen tells you exactly how far along a large process is towards completion. Plus, the transition to Python means it is available for both Windows and Linux.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">The project is open source, and both the code and the finished product can be downloaded from Sourceforge. You can find the link to that on <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/labs/software">MousePaw Labs</a>.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Redstring 2.1 is already in the works, introducing some powerful new features like paragraph mode, which allows for creating entire blocks of code at once, and a random result selector, when you don't want to use ALL the combinations. Redstring 2.1 is set to release sometime early December.</p>
