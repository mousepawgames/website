# MousePaw Media Websites

The MousePaw Games and MousePaw Media websites are made with HTML5 and CSS3.
Our goal is to keep the amount of Javascript to a minimum.

The `stable` branch contains the versions currently live on `mousepawmedia.com`
and `mousepawgames.com`. The `master` branch is the current work-in-progress
versions of the sites.
