                    So you want to get involved with MousePaw Media's open
                    source development? Awesome! We've worked hard to make
                    this process and smooth and simple as possible.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Read through our
                        <a href=/termsofdevelopment target=_blank>
                            Terms of Development
                        </a>, which you are agreeing to by contributing code to
                        MousePaw Media. This is to save everyone a few dozen
                        headaches; it assures you that we'll always be open
                        source, and it enables us to re-license the code as
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sign into our instance of <a href=/devnet target=_blank>
                            Phabricator on DevNet
                        </a> using your GitHub credentials. This is where all
                        of our development work takes place.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        </a> (also hosted on <a href=/devnet>DevNet</a>), which
                        will walk you through the process of setting up your
                        development environment and checking out a repository.

                        The best way to connect with us is through Phabricator,
                        but depending on the day and time, you may be able to
                        find us on our <a href=/irc target=_blank>

                        Why do I need a GitHub account?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        GitHub is fairly ubiquitous among programmers; the
                        majority of developers have accounts there. GitHub
                        accounts are also more frequently legitimate -
                        developers rely on them to track and display their code
                        contributions - which helps us ensure that the majority
                        of people signing up for Phabricator are <em>real
                        people</em>.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why don't you accept GitHub pull requests?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We use Phabricator for all of our development work.
                        We've found that the features of that platform fit our
                        workflow better than GitHub does.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What are those weird ".arc[whatever]" files on your
                        repositories?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Those allow Phabricator to interface with Git and do all
                        sorts of neat code review stuff for us. You can safely
                        ignore those - you will never need them.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>

                        What's with the Terms of Development?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        That's to save everyone a few dozen headaches. If we
                        realize later that we need to license a project under
                        different terms, we don't want to try and track down a
                        few hundred people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides that, it simply states that your code is
                        licensed to us under the MIT License, unless you select
                        another non-restrictive open source license that is
                        compatible with GPL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, it holds us accountable - as long as we're using
                        your code, the project you contributed to shall have an
                        open-source license.
