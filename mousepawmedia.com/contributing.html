                    So you want to get involved with MousePaw Media's open
                    source development? Awesome! We've worked hard to make
                    this process and smooth and simple as possible.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Read through our
                        <a href=/termsofdevelopment target=_blank>
                            Terms of Development
                        </a>, which you are agreeing to by contributing code or
                        other content to MousePaw Media. This is to save
                        everyone a few dozen headaches; it assures you that
                        we'll always be open source, and it enables us to
                        re-license the code and content as necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sign into our instance of <a href=/devnet target=_blank>
                            Phabricator on DevNet
                        </a> using your GitHub credentials. This is where all
                        of our development work takes place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow our

                            handy Getting Started guide
                        </a> (hosted on <a href=/devnet>DevNet</a>), which
                        will walk you through the process of setting up your
                        development environment and checking out a repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The best way to connect with us is through Phabricator,
                        but depending on the day and time, you may be able to
                        find us on our <a href=/irc target=_blank>Freenode IRC chatroom</a>.

                    <p class=days>
                        Why do I need a GitHub account?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        GitHub is fairly ubiquitous among programmers; the
                        majority of developers have accounts there. GitHub
                        accounts are also more frequently legitimate -
                        developers rely on them to track and display their code
                        contributions - which helps us ensure that the majority
                        of people signing up for Phabricator are <em>real
                        people</em>.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why don't you accept GitHub pull requests?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We use Phabricator for all of our development work.
                        We've found that the features of that platform fit our
                        workflow better than GitHub does.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What are those weird ".arc[whatever]" files on your
                        repositories?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Those allow Phabricator to interface with Git and do all
                        sorts of neat code review stuff for us. You can safely
                        ignore those - you will never need them.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What's with the Terms of Development?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        That's to save everyone a few dozen headaches. If we
                        realize later that we need to license a project under
                        different terms, we don't want to try and track down a
                        few hundred people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides that, it simply states that your code is
                        licensed to us under the MIT License, unless you select
                        the BSD 3-Clause License. Your non-code content is
                        licensed under Creative Commons Attribution.

                    <p>
                        Third, it holds us accountable - as long as we're using
                        your code, the project you contributed to shall have an
                        open-source license.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Don't the Terms of Development still leave room for you
                        to profit from my contribution?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. However, no open source license prevents that!
                        Under any Open Source license, anyone can create
                        derivate works, and can also sell those derivative
                        works. Very few licenses even prevent others from
                        making those derivative works proprietary and
                        closed-source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, in exchange for your permission to
                        relicense, the Terms of Development is actually
                        granting you <em>more</em> of a guarantee than most
                        open source licenses would; we will always ensure that
                        any project we use your contribution in has at least
                        one open source license.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        Why not just use the GPL and be done with it?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We believe in open source and software freedom, but we
                        also recognize that there are situations where it
                        is appropriate for software to be closed-source.
                        We are only a viable company because of non-GPL
                        licenses, and we want to extend that same consideration
                        to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are situations where we use the GPL as our
                        outbound license, for its protections and its viability
                        in creating dual-license structures, but for our code
                        to be as free and open as we want, we need the
                        flexibility of less restrictive licenses.
