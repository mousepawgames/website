                    For nearly three decades, Anne McDonald has been helping to
                    equip and train authors in the art of story crafting, drawing
                    from her years of diverse experience in fiction writing,
                    journalism, and editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This growing collection of tools and references is sourced
                    in part from the original resources that were once found
                    on the now-defunct Dancing Word Writers Network, a large
                    online community for fiction authors that thrived for
                    nearly a decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These resources are now used in the Content Development
                    department at MousePaw Media, and are made available here
                    to aid authors both young and old.

                        Will you be adding more Resources?

                        Yes. We only recently added this collection, and are
                        in the process of redesigning and updating the
                        resources from our archives.

                        I've got some resources I think would make great
                        additions to the collection. Can I send them to you?
