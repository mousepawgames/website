                    MousePaw Media believes that the best ideas are worth
                    sharing. This is why we've decided to make all of our core
                    technologies open source! This way, individuals, educators,
                    students, and many software projects can use our code and
                    technology! Everyone is free to read, modify, use, and share
                    our open source work.

                        Open source is a software distribution model that
                        promotes the free and unrestricted use, sharing, and
                        modification of computer code. More information can

                        What license(s) do you use?

                    <p class=days>
                        Why aren't you closed-source like most game companies?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        For the past 25+ years, the educational software
                        industry has been dominated by a profit-first,
                        closed-source model. In many cases, this has produced
                        expensive software with design flaws and bugs,
                        destined to be discontinued rather than improved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We envision a game engine that allows our games, and
                        anything else anyone builds using it, to survive the
                        waves of changing technology. Maybe our games can even
                        outlive the company itself!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        If your code is all freely available, how can you
                        even make money?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Open source is an amazing idea! There are a few ways
                        to stay open-source and run a viable software company.
                        Our method is best described as "free the code, sell
                        the content." We aren't selling the code that runs
                        <em>Operation SpyRat</em>; we are selling the story,
                        animations, and educational content within it. It's
                        a little like selling a movie you made, but giving
                        away the awesome film-making equipment you used to
                        make it.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why aren't you <em>completely</em> open source?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Making high-quality educational software requires
                        a lot of work, and we believe we can best accomplish
                        it as a company. In order to pay our wonderful team,
                        run our servers, and keep the lights on, we need to
                        make money somehow. We believe that selling many of
                        the games themselves is the best way to do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, our <em>code</em> is open-source, while
                        our <em>content</em> and <em>graphics</em> are
                        closed-source. We ultimately sell the final
                        combination thereof.
                    </p></div>

                        Why "Open Source" instead of "Free Software"?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We were inspired to join the movement often collectively
                        called "FOSS" (Free and Open Source Software) or "FLOSS"
                        (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) by Eric S.
                        Raymond's
                        <em><a href='http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/' target=_blank>Cathedral and the Bazaar</a></em>.
                        As far we can tell, the open source vision has the best
                        track record of the two movements for leveling walls
                        and encouraging collaboration among people, FOSS groups,
                        and software companies. That's why we have thrown our
                        support behind the
                        <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target=_blank>Open Source Initiative</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While we recognize that the "Free Software" movement
                        has spawned many great pieces of software, it also has
                        a long history of building walls of distrust among
                        well-meaning software companies, and even between
                        FOSS groups themselves. We want to make peace and
                        software, not join another war.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                    <p class=days>
                        Why do you use the GPL, then?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        The GPL, or "General Public License," is the core of the
                        Free Software movement. While we don't agree with the
                        doctrine behind the license, we recognize that it
                        <em>can</em> be used judiciously to further the place
                        of free and open source software in the market.
                    </p>
                    <p><p class=center>(Click a question to view the answer.)</p>
                        We only use the GPL for certain major pieces of our
                        game engine, to ensure that they are only used for
                        free to create more free and open source [FOSS]
                        projects. If anyone wants to use our game engine
                        for a closed-source commercial product, they can
                        purchase a license. Part of those proceeds will be
                        donated to the Open Source Initiative. Either way,
                        FOSS wins!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why this licensing setup?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We are strong proponents of the Open Source movement
                        (contrasted with the Free Software movement). However,
                        we believe that our development staff deserves to
                        get paid a living wage down the road (once we start
                        selling our games). Thus, if someone else wants to
                        profit from the fruits of their labors without also
                        sharing in kind, our developers deserve a piece of that
                        pie.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is worth noting that a part of those profits are
                        also earmarked for supporting open-source software
                        projects that we use.
