                <h1>Community Internships</h1>
                <p>
                    In response to international interest in our internship
                    program, we've created the Community Internship, which
                    leverages our open source development program to offer
                    training and experience to budding professionals around the
                    world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most ways, Community Internships are no different from
                    our standard U.S.-based Internship Program. You receive the
                    same one-on-one attention and training, and most of the same
                    experience opportunities are available to you. Upon
                    completion of the 240-hour program, you even receive a
                    Letter of Recommendation and the option to use us as a job
                    reference.

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few key differences with a Community Internship
                    that allow us to work internationally.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No equity or college credit is earned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some leadership training opportunities are limited,
                        since Community Interns cannot be granted internal
                        security clearance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Community Interns are still considered volunteer
                        open source contributors, not employees.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, these limitations have no impact on the quality
                    of training your receive. You're still considered an equal
                    part of the team!
                </p>

                <h2>Requirements</h2>

                <p class=center>(Click a question to view the answer.)</p>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Are unpaid internships legal?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        It depends on a number of factors, including your
                        country's laws. We aim to comply with U.S. Labor Laws
                        regarding internships, by providing interns with
                        extensive one-on-one training and mentorship, and by
                        ensuring interns are not working the same hours one
                        would expect of an employee.
                    </p><p>
                        The Community Internship is an extension of our
                        open source development program, so it is considered
                        entirely voluntary. Your continued participation is up
                        to you, although you must complete the program to
                        receive the Letter of Recommendation.
                    </p><p>
                        Of course, every country has different laws regarding
                        internships. You should find out about your country's
                        laws and regulations, and determine whether our program
                        fulfills them satisfactorily.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why do you have such a strict interview/screening process?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Two reasons. First, since we're limited in how many
                        interns we can support at a time, we want to ensure
                        this opportunity is open to those individuals who will
                        make the most of it.
                    </p><p>
                        Second, since we're all about career preparation, we
                        want to provide an interview process as rigorous as any
                        you'd encounter in the industry. In many cases, we
                        provide feedback to applicants on how they can interview
                        better, even if we choose not to bring them on!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why do you require such high English proficiency?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Being able to understand and communicate clearly in
                        written and spoken English is pivotal to nearly every
                        part of the internship program. There are few, if any,
                        tasks which do not require reading, writing, speaking,
                        or listening. We find that ILR 3 (Professional Working
                        Proficiency) is the absolute minimum English proficiency
                        level that will still enable success.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What time zone are you in?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        MousePaw Media is based out of Idaho, United States of
                        America, and we work on the US/Pacific Time Zone
                        (UTC+8, UTC+7 on Daylight Savings Time).
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        How do you work across time zones?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We primarily schedule around North American time zones
                        for meetings and collaborative sessions. However,
                        since our entire team is remote and distributed,
                        we're not limited to typical "business hours". We try
                        to find times within normal waking hours that work for
                        all parties.
                    </p><p>
                        Depending on your time zone, scheduling may require some
                        flexibility from you, such as occasionally being
                        available a little earlier or later than you might
                        typically work. However, since only a fraction of your
                        work involves live collaboration, you'll usually be
                        able to stick with your own preferred schedule.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        How often do we have video chat meetings?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Each team usually meets once a week at a regular time.
                        These are working meetings, and we tend to get a lot
                        done during them. These are scheduled around everyone's
                        availability as much as possible.
                    </p><p>
                        In addition, you will have regular meetings with your
                        internship supervisor, typically every other week (less
                        as time goes on.)
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm not certain what exactly I want to do.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        That's part of the purpose of an internship. You will
                        have the opportunity to try things out and make
                        discoveries about your interests and abilities.
