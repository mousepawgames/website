                <h2>Vector Animation Reimagined</h2>
                <p>
                    Anari is MousePaw Media's original, open source animation
                    engine, which is designed to deliver high-performance vector
                    animations and interactivity tools.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Powerful and Complete.</h2>
                <p>
                    Anari will be a complete animation system, offering all
                    the tools you would expect for vector animation, collision
                    detection, and user interactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Anari library itself is being designed as a decoupled
                    back-end, so multiple front-end renderers can be designed
                    using different languages and libraries.
                </p>

                <h2>Memory Conscious Design.</h2>
                <p>
                    Many animation platforms make considerable demands on
                    computer hardware. Anari is being built from the ground up
                    to optimize memory and CPU usage wherever possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anari will use our other libraries - namely PawLIB,
                    Stormsound, and Ratscript, to offer sound playback and
                    interactivity with the best possible performance.

                <h2>Bridge the Gap.</h2>
                <p>
                    Certain popular commercial animation platforms have been
                    forcing their users to switch to HTML5. While this format is
                    great for some projects, it is ill-suited to many others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anari is designed to work with system-level graphics drawing
                    to provide native rendering support, for everyone who wants
                    to build software, not websites in disguise.

                        Why vector graphics?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Many high-quality cartoons have been produced using
                        vector-based animation, including
                        <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>,
                        <em>Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman</em>,
                        <em>Gravity Falls</em>, and <em>Peg + Cat</em>. It is
                        a versitile art form with many unique tools to aid
                        the animator.
                    </p><p>
                        There are currently very few game engines which support
                        true vector-based art, and even fewer are open source.
                        We hope to fill that gap.

                        What is Anari's license?

                        Anari is licensed under the
                        <a href=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0 target=_blank>GPL 3.0</a>,
                        so you can use it for any open-source project. We'll be
                        switching to a slightly less restrictive open source
                        license soon, to allow compatibility with
                        permissive-licensed projects.
                    </p><p>
                        If you want to use Anari in a closed-source project,
                        we'll be offering a paid license upon release.

                        Anari is still fairly early in its development cycle,
                        so it's almost impossible to give a date of completion.
