                <p>
                    PawLIB is a collection of data structures, classes, and
                    tools designed to make C++ easier, friendlier, and
                    more efficient to use.

                <h2>Flex Data Structures</h2>
                <p>
                    Dynamic allocation is the key to all "magically" resizing
                    data structures, but it is also a major cause of
                    performance issues. PawLIB's Flex data structures help
                    to alleviate some of these problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FlexArray, FlexQueue, and FlexStack are largely analogous
                    in function to std::vector, std::queue, and std::stack,
                    but prove to be consistently faster in benchmark tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future versions of PawLIB will bring additional Flex
                    data structures (such as FlexBit and FlexMap), as well as
                    further optimizations.
                </p>

                <h2>IOChannel</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you move beyond basic strings, printing to the console
                    using std::iostream can be quite non-trivial in C++.
                    PawLIB's IOChannel is a wrapper for std::cout and printf,
                    offering a whole bevy of powerful and intuitive features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Intelligently converts and displays ANY basic data type,
                        including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans,
                        and more!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Format output colors and attributes (i.e. bold,
                        underline) using simple flags. (This will be
                        automatically cross-compatible in future versions.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Categorize and prioritize messages, allowing you to
                        suppress certain messages on-the-fly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Easily output pointer addresses and raw memory dumps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Route messages to multiple outputs, including the
                        standard ostream buffer and custom functions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Goldilocks</h2>
                <p>
                    While many C++ projects ship with tests, the code has to
                    be recompiled before those tests can be run. PawLIB
                    Goldilocks offers an alternative: you can write your
                    tests and actually compile them into your production
                    code! Then, the tests can be executed on-the-fly from
                    within a custom program console.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goldilocks' built-in benchmarker even allows you to run
                    comparative benchmarks on any system, without having to
                    install special software. The detailed results let you
                    verify the statistical validity of the benchmark, thereby
                    accounting for common causes of benchmark inaccuracies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A later version of PawLIB will also include Blueshell,
                    which will allow you to quickly implement a custom
                    interactive console for Goldilocks.

                <h2>Trilean</h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wished you could handle uncertainty in your flag
                    variables and conditionals? PawLIB Trilean makes this
                    possible!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trilean is a true atomic data type that always behaves
                    how you'd expect. It has three unique states - true, false,
                    and maybe - and is fully compatible with boolean variables
                    and constants, as well as all C++ conditional statements and
                    relevant operators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No surprises, no hacks, no inconsistencies - just real,
                    atomic trilean variables in C++.
                </p>
                <code>
                    tril foo = maybe;<br/>
                    if(foo) // or '(foo == true)'<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;//True<br/>
                    else if(!foo) // or '(foo == false)'<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;//False<br/>
                    else if(~exampleTrilean) // or '(foo == maybe)'<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;//Maybe<br/>

                <h2>Pool</h2>
                <p>
                    The object pool design pattern is frequently used in
                    game design to better manage memory in certain scenarios.
                    To use this pattern in C++, however, you usually have to
                    implement it yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PawLIB Pool is a general purpose implementation of the
                    object pool design pattern. It allows you to create,
                    manage, and remove objects safely using Pool's own reference
                    variables, thereby avoiding potential memory issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, Pool is generally slower than straight dynamic
                    allocation. We hope to improve performance of Pool in a
                    future version of PawLIB.

                <h2>OneString</h2>
                <p class='small center'>
                    (Experimental, Releasing in 1.1)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone who has tried to work with std::string and Unicode
                    knows the two don't play well together. They never have!
                    OneString fixes that: it is the first C++ string class to
                    be fully compatible with Unicode in all operations, while
                    being completely cross-compatible with std::string and
                    C-strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, imagine a string that is functionally
                    identical to std::string, while fully supporting Unicode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OneString is built on the same algorithm as the Flex
                    data structures, which holds promise for major gains in
                    performance in later versions.

                        Isn't this reinventing the wheel?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Maybe, although
                        <a href=https://www.indeliblebluepen.com/beware-the-trendites/ target=_blank>
                            that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
                        </a>
                        We have different performance and development goals
                        than the ones that the C++ standard library and
                        Boost were designed for.
                    </p><p>
                        It is true that some of PawLIB's functionality may
                        be redundant, but this is largely an opportunity to
                        explore new algorithms, features, and optimizations.
                        It's already paying off, as some of PawLIB's features
                        are indeed benchmarking faster than the standard
                        library.
