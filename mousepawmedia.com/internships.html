                <p>
                    We offer internships to students and entry-level
                    professionals in the Inland Northwest. Our goal is to
                    cultivate the skills and character traits required to
                    succeed as a professional in one's chosen field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've worked with students from Eastern Washington
                    University, Gonzaga, Whitworth, and University of Idaho,
                    building upon the skills acquired in the classroom to
                    help our interns transition into the workplace.
                </p>
                <p>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Is there a maximum weekly commitment?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Nope. You can work as much as you want. We only
                        require the minimum hours each week, and the rest is
                        your decision. Just be sure you keep everything
                        in balance!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm concerned about school/work/life balance.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Your academic and personal life are very important!
                        Part of being industry-ready is knowing how to balance.
                        Your internship supervisor can help you with
                        scheduling, planning, and other life skills to aid you
                        in that.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                        How often do I need to drive out to Coeur d'Alene?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We host company social events twice a year. These are
                        optional but recommended -- we have a good time and it's
                        a wonderful chance to get to know your coworkers better.
                        In addition, we encourage interns to stop by when they
                        find it more productive to meet with us in person for
                        training or collaboration.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        How often do we have video chat meetings?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Each team usually meets once a week at a regular time.
                        These are working meetings, and we tend to get a lot
                        done during them. These are scheduled around everyone's
                        availability as much as possible.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm not certain what exactly I want to do.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        That's part of the purpose of an internship. You will
                        have the opportunity to try things out and make
                        discoveries about your interests and abilities.
