                    <em>Operation SpyRat</em> originally came from Jason C. McDonald's
                    imagination – it first took the form of a free web game on
                    his (now defunct) website, KidMagine.com. Jason heads up the
                    programming department, with eight computer languages under
                    his belt. He is the primary designer of Ratscript, the
                    company's in-house programming language.

                <p>
                    A TBI survivor, Jason is acutely aware of life with a
                    learning disability, yet he doesn't let his challenges slow
                    him down. In addition to his role in the company, he mentors
                    young programmers, and speaks on the topic of software
                    development.

                    Anne McDonald’s background as a writer and editor has
                    deepened her love for the English language. Her experience
                    as a homeschooling parent, and as part of the recovery team
                    for helping Jason rebuild his language skills after a
                    traumatic brain injury, has given her extensive knowledge
                    about education, especially for disabled and hands-on
                    learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She has a keen eye and ear for detail, which she applies to

                    work over the years makes her about as adaptable as her
                    armadillo counterpart, <em>Annie A. Armadillo</em>. Whatever
                    she doesn't know, she can find out.
