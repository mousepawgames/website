                <p>
                    <strong>29 April 2020</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're excited to announce <strong>GAME MODE 2020</strong>,
                    an event where our entire development team drops
                    everything they're doing for the month of June
                    and joins forces to build a game. We're inviting the
                    community to join in the fun: coding, designing,
                    and (of course) playtesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of development time at MousePaw Media goes into
                    building the game engine that will serve as the foundation
                    for ambitious future projects. GAME MODE provides a break
                    from the routine, and allows us to get in touch with our
                    first passion: to create amazing games.
                </p>
                <h2>About the Game</h2>
                <p>
                    This year, we'll be developing <strong>DiamondQuest</strong>,
                    a math-focused platformer built on the philosophy of
                    "accessibility-first". The goal is to create a game that
                    provides a first-class video game experience to players
                    with motor impairments, for whom mouse gestures, keyboard
                    combinations, or reflex actions are difficult or
                    impossible. Even so, DiamondQuest is designed to be fun
                    for everyone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As to its educational goals, DiamondQuest will provide a
                    relaxing and adventurous environment to tackle something
                    students ordinarily hate: the all-important math drill
                    practice. Most similar games try to lend excitement to
                    math drills with timers and a sense of urgency, but this
                    can trigger sympoms of math anxiety, further hampering
                    learning. DiamondQuest will take a different approach:
                    a rewards-based system that encourages players to keep
                    going with the promise of treasure to be discovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Design-wise, DiamondQuest draws inspiration from
                    mining-based platformer games like
                    <emphasis>Terraria</emphasis>, but with an emphasis on
                    the wonders of the underground.
                    It will feature 16-bit-inspired artwork, keyboard-only
                    gameplay, and an original score. The first version,
                    produced during GAME MODE, is likely to keep things
                    simple, but we hope to set the stage for future expansion.
                </p>
                <h2>Call for Contributors</h2>
                <p>
                    So, is it possible for us to build DiamondQuest in just
                    one month? We're certainly going to try, and we would love
                    if you'd join us. The entire game will be developed as
                    an open source, Creative Commons project. We welcome help
                    with everything: coding (in Python), artwork, music and
                    sound, packaging and distribution, content development,
                    and everything in between.
                </p>

                    Further details, including possible live coding sessions,
                    will be announced over the coming weeks. If you want to
                    follow our progress, we'll also be posting
