                    Many fans and followers of MousePaw Games may have noticed
                    that a promised game release has come and gone without a
                    word. <em>Omission</em> is a new game which has been
                    forthcoming for over a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MousePaw Games already released a game trailer for
                    <em>Omission</em>, depicting the proposed final gameplay.
                    Some testers were even able to play the game early. It's
                    obvious the game was done, so what happened?
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I've said for years, packaging in Python is like beating
                    yourself to death with a wet trout," explains Lead Developer
                    Jason C. McDonald. "That's become less true over the years,
                    unless you were using one of those Python libraries that
                    just didn't package well. That's the wall we hit."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right out of the gate, <em>Omission</em> proved difficult
                    to package and distribute, due to several bugs and odd
                    dependency issues in Kivy, the GUI library it relied on.
                    "We tried everything, from traditional Debian packaging
                    to Snapcraft, tarballs to AppImage. We'd hit a brick wall
                    each time," says McDonald.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, almost a year overdue, and no closer to packaging,
                    MousePaw Games has pulled the plug on releasing
                    <em>Omission</em> 1.0. Development has begun on version
                    1.1, using Qt 5 via the PySide 2 bindings. The team
                    anticipates new challenges relating to the pre-release
                    toolkit, but hopes to have a completed game before the
                    year is out. "At least Qt has a history of being packaged,"
                    McDonald remarked.
