                    MousePaw Games is gearing up to release a brand new
                    open source game, <em>Omission</em>, and is inviting
                    anyone interested to help playtest the game before
                    its September 2017 release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Omission</em> is based on a deceptively simple premise:
                    find what letter was removed from a famous passage.
                    Players can choose from three game modes: beating the clock,
                    avoiding mistakes, or just leisurely racking up as many
                    points as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald described his inspiration.
                    "The digital age has us trained to read past typos. We
                    automatically see 'cofee' as 'coffee' and 'prty' as 'party'.
                    <em>Omission</em> challenges players to train themselves
                    to do the opposite - to spot what's missing."
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure the finished product is polished and functional
                    on as many environments as possible, MousePaw Media is
                    putting out the call for game testers. Signing up to test
                    <em>Omission</em> is free and easy, and only takes a few
                    minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the pre-release is sent out to testers, they will have
                    until August 21st to play the game and complete the
                    related survey. Feedback will be used to improve the game
                    before its official release.
                </p>
