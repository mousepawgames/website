                <h1>PawLIB 1.0 Released</h1>

                <p>
                    <strong>14 June 2017</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    After two years of development effort, MousePaw Media is
                    proud to announce the first official release of PawLIB!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The release, codenamed "Willow Sapling," brings many
                    exciting features to C++, including the Flex data structures
                    the release name alludes to. FlexArray, FlexQueue, and
                    FlexStack provide high-performance alternatives to the
                    familiar standard-library vector, queue, and stack
                    classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald is thrilled about this
                    milestone. "PawLIB has been in the works for a long time,
                    but we've finally completed the first version. We wanted
                    to make sure it was polished."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm excited. We're taking an honestly really big step in
                    code, in experimentation in the company," said Nathan
                    Groggett, who led the taskforce responsible for final review
                    and documentation tasks. "We're moving forward, and that
                    feels great."
                </p>
                <p>
                    When asked about the release, Assistant Lead Developer
                    Jarek Thomas reported, "It's a relief to finally get it out.
                    I'm excited that our data structures are actually faster
                    than the standard library."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from the Flex data structures, PawLIB sports a number
                    of new innovations. Goldilocks, the built-in testing
                    and benchmarking framework, is one such example. In
                    addition to allowing tests to be compiled into production
                    code, it includes a comparative benchmarker with extensive
                    statistical data for performance analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PawLIB is obviously an unusual project, as it attempts to
                    outperform implementations which have been in use for
                    years. "Some people may ask, 'why was this done?'" said
                    Jarek Thomas, "but others will say 'this is awesome' and
                    use it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    This first version also includes a feature-rich message
                    output system (IOChannel), an atomic true/false/maybe
                    data type (Trilean), and a general-use implementation
                    of the Pool design pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bowen Volwiler, who helped write the documentation for
                    the release, observed, "It's really interesting to look
                    at how we can take something that already exists and
                    make improvements no one would think to make,
                    challenging the status quo."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team is already making plans for the next release,
                    PawLIB 1.1, which will see the addition of the long-awaited
                    Unicode string class, OneString.
                </p>
                <p>
