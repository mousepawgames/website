            <h1>General Community Rules</h1>
			<p>
				<b>NOTE:</b> We try to follow the
                <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct",target=_blank>Ubuntu Code of Conduct</a>.
                Many of the points below are derived from that document.
			</p>
            <p>
				<b>NOTE:</b> This is the generic version of the
                <a href="/communityrules",target=_blank>
                    MousePaw Media Community Rules,
                </a> rewritten for communities not directly operated by
                MousePaw Media.
			</p>
            <p>
                By participating in this community, you agree to abide by
                our community rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RESPECT:</b> Everyone is entitled to basic respect,
                period. Assume the best, aim to resolve conflict, and treat
                others the way you want to be treated. Harassment, hate
                speech, bullying, "flaming" and "trolling" will not be
                tolerated in any form.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RESPONSIBILITY:</b> Mistakes are a natural part of
                growth. Each individual in the community should be honest
                about and willing to learn from from these mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>COMMUNICATION:</b> Don't be shy about sharing ideas,
                asking questions, or expressing concerns; also, please
                respect others' right to communicate the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</b> If you don't know something,
                please ask for help! We are all growing and learning.
                Meanwhile, please don't answer questions in a rude or
                flippant manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>COLLABORATION:</b> We welcome your ideas and
                collaborative efforts. Please remember that our projects are
                the culmination of many ideas. Regard the contributions of
                others with the same value you place on your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>STEPPING DOWN:</b> Your participation is voluntary. If you
                decide you don't want to be involved in the community in some
                capacity anymore, that is your right. However, please be
                considerate in how you step down, so as to minimize disruption
                to the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>LANGUAGE:</b> We ask that our community members not use
                crude or foul language (i.e. profanity, racism, etc.). This
                includes "obfuscation" of such language, such as through
                substituting symbols for the letters. This rule helps keep
                our communication friendly, and promotes use of *real* words
                to express ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>CONTENT:</b> We ask that our community members do not
                post any content which is "NSFW" (not safe/appropriate for
                work), "mature audiences only," or otherwise stronger than a
                "PG" rating. This includes material which is violent,
                sexual, or encouraging illegal activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO LITTERING:</b> Please don't create content which serves
                absolutely no purpose to the community's goal. Fun, humor, and
                occasional off-topic talk is welcome (especially in comments and
                chat) as long as it doesn't interfere with the community's
                goals, but please don't clutter up the community with useless
                noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO VANDALISM:</b> Do not attempt to deface, remove, or
                otherwise destroy your contributions, or the contributions
                of others. (This does NOT include revision or removal of
                comments.) If you need something removed, contact an
                administrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO CRACKING:</b> We have set various security measures
                and permissions controls in place throughout our network. Do
                not tamper with these or attempt to break them; doing so is
                a serious violation, generally resulting in immediate and
                permanent removal from the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO ADVERTISING:</b> You may not post anything designed
                solely to promote another website, product, service, or the
                like. You MAY post links and/or information relevant to a
                conversation. The line between relevance and promotion is
                highly contextual, and is ultimately up to the discretion of
                the moderators.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO SCRAPING:</b> You may not collect bulk information
                about our staff or community members by any means for any
                reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>YOUR ACCOUNT:</b> You are solely responsible for the
                maintenance and operation of your account in compliance with
                these rules. If you believe your account has been
                compromised, contact the community's administrators.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MODERATORS:</b> All moderators have final authority. Their
                decision shall be considered final - modification and reversal
                of decisions are internal moderation issues. In the event of a
                conflict between moderators and community members, contact an
                administrator privately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>OUR RIGHTS:</b> The community administrators retain the
                exclusive rights of full control over all aspects of the
                community network, including...
                <ul class=list>
                    <li>The right to add, modify, and remove any content as we see fit.</li>
                    <li>The right to add, modify, and remove features and access to features as we see fit.</li>
                    <li>The right to grant and revoke anyone's access to the community, as we see fit.</li>
                    <li>The right to revise these rules as we see fit.</li>
