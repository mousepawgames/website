                <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve realized how much of what I learned in
                    grade school was far from the complete truth. Much of our
                    modern education system subscribes to the idea of strategic
                    lying to make learning easier for children. The difficult
                    truth, however, is that we are trading in long-term success
                    for short-term understanding. Much of higher education is
                    spent &quot;unlearning&quot; what we were mistaught in the
                    first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MousePaw Media approaches education from a daring
                    perspective. Instead of relying on shortcuts and modified
                    terminology with a very short mileage, we aim to introduce
                    the real concepts in an age-appropriate fashion right from
                    the start, and then building on that knowledge. In reality,
                    we aren’t changing what concepts a young child learns. We
                    are simply introducing and building on the logic and
                    vocabulary they will be using for the rest of their lives,
                    in a manner that excites and rekindles the natural love of
                    learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another fundamental difference in our educational approach
                    is in the presentation of the questions, and not just the
                    answers. There is so much in our world left to be
                    discovered, and we believe we are helping to train the next
                    generation of great leaders, scientists, mathematicians,
                    writers, philosophers, engineers, and historians. We’ve
                    abandoned the theory of “learning by rote,” and are taking
                    the approach of equipping students with the knowledge and
                    tools they need to answer those great questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also know that some of those questions have answers well
                    outside the realm of present thought, as was the case with
                    greats like Newton and Einstein. We aim to present the facts
                    in their most current form, without cultural, philosophical,
                    political, or scientific bias. We hope to expose kids to a
                    wide range of ideas, giving them the tools and the courage
                    they need to blaze new trails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, MousePaw Media's educational philosophy can be
                    summed up like this: Every child is capable of their own
                    unique greatness, and MousePaw Media is dedicated to helping
                    them discover and achieve that greatness, whatever it may
                    be.
