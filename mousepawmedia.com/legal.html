                        Identification of the material that you claim is

                Notices of copyright infringement claims should be sent to our

                We will begin investigating the alleged copyright infringement;
                however, before we are required to take any action, we must
                receive a signed statement that the above information is
                accurate; that you have a good faith belief that the identified
                use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner,
                its agent, or the law; and, under penalty of perjury, that you
                are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the
                copyright owner's behalf in this situation. This must be
                received by mail or by fax. Mail or fax delivery details will be
                sent in reply to your initial notice.
