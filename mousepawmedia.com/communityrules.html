            <h1>MousePaw Media Community Rules</h1>
			<p>
				<b>NOTE:</b> We try to follow the
                <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct",target=_blank>Ubuntu Code of Conduct</a>.
                Many of the points below are derived from that document.
			</p>
            <p>
                By using any part of the MousePaw Media Development Network,
                including DevNet and the MousePaw Media IRC channels, you
                agree to abide by our community rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RESPECT:</b> Everyone is entitled to basic respect,
                period. Assume the best, aim to resolve conflict, and treat
                others the way you want to be treated. Harassment, hate
                speech, bullying, "flaming" and "trolling" will not be
                tolerated in any form.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RESPONSIBILITY:</b> Mistakes are a natural part of
                growth. Each individual in the community should be honest
                about and willing to learn from from these mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>COMMUNICATION:</b> Don't be shy about sharing ideas,
                asking questions, or expressing concerns; also, please
                respect others' right to communicate the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</b> If you don't know something,
                please ask for help! We are all growing and learning.
                Meanwhile, please don't answer questions in a rude or
                flippant manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>COLLABORATION:</b> We welcome your ideas and
                collaborative efforts. Please remember that our projects are
                the culmination of many ideas. Regard the contributions of
                others with the same value you place on your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>STEPPING DOWN:</b> Your participation is voluntary. If
                you decide you don't want to be involved in a project
                anymore, that is your right. However, please be considerate
                in how you step down, so as to minimize disruption to the
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>LANGUAGE:</b> We ask that our community members not use
                crude or foul language (i.e. profanity, racism, etc.). This
                includes "obfuscation" of such language, such as through
                substituting symbols for the letters. This rule helps keep
                our communication friendly, and promotes use of *real* words
                to express ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>CONTENT:</b> We ask that our community members do not
                post any content which is "NSFW" (not safe/appropriate for
                work), "mature audiences only," or otherwise stronger than a
                "PG" rating. This includes material which is violent,
                sexual, or encouraging illegal activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO LITTERING:</b> Please don't create posts or other
                content which serves absolutely no purpose to the project.
                Fun, humor, and occasional off-topic talk is welcome
                (especially in comments and chat) as long as we're getting
                the work done, but please don't clutter up the network with
                useless noise. On Phabricator, use appropriate tools (such
                as Tokens) for giving generic feedback; use comments for
                more specific feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO VANDALISM:</b> Do not attempt to deface, remove, or
                otherwise destroy your contributions, or the contributions
                of others. (This does NOT include revision or removal of
                comments.) If you need something removed, contact an
                administrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO CRACKING:</b> We have set various security measures
                and permissions controls in place throughout our network. Do
                not tamper with these or attempt to break them; doing so is
                a serious violation, generally resulting in immediate and
                permanent removal from the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO ADVERTISING:</b> You may not post anything designed
                solely to promote another website, product, service, or the
                like. You MAY post links and/or information relevant to a
                conversation. The line between relevance and promotion is
                highly contextual, and is ultimately up to the discretion of
                the moderators.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NO SCRAPING:</b> You may not collect bulk information
                about our staff or community members by any means for any
                reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>YOUR ACCOUNT:</b> You are solely responsible for the
                maintenance and operation of your account in compliance with
                these rules. If you believe your account has been
                compromised, contact us at developers@mousepawmedia.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MODERATORS:</b> All MousePaw Media staff have the full
                authority of moderators in all cases. Their decision shall
                be considered final - modification and reversal of decisions
                are internal company issues. As such, do not dispute staff
                decisions publicly. In the event of a conflict between staff
                and community members, contact an administrator (such as Jason
                C. McDonald [jcmcdonald] or Anne McDonald [ajmcdonald])
                privately.
            </p>
