                https://mousepawgames.com, https://mousepawmedia.net,
                https://mousepawgames.net or any of its subdomains, you are
                agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable
                laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for
                compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not
                agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using
                or accessing these sites. The materials contained in these
                websites are protected by applicable copyright and trademark
                law.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Use License</h2>
            <p>
                The following license is in effect for all materials
                (information or software) on MousePaw Media's websites which
                do not have another explicitly-stated license.
            </p>
            <p>
                Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the
                materials (information or software) on MousePaw Media's websites
                for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is
                the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under
                this license you may not:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    modify or copy the materials;
                </li>
                <li>
                    use the materials for any commercial purpose;
                </li>
                <li>
                    attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software
                    contained on MousePaw Media's websites;
                </li>
                <li>
                    remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from
                    the materials; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the
                    materials on any other server, except for explicitly
                    historic archival purposes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any
                of these restrictions and may be terminated by MousePaw Media
                at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials
                or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any
                downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic
                or printed format.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                The materials on MousePaw Media's websites are provided on an
                'as is' basis. MousePaw Media makes no warranties, expressed
                or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
                warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties
                or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular
                purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or
                other violation of rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, MousePaw Media does not warrant or make any
                representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
                reliability of the use of the materials on its website or
                otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked
                to this site.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                In no event shall MousePaw Media or its suppliers be
                liable for any damages (including, without limitation,
                damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business
                interruption) arising out of the use or inability to
                use the materials on MousePaw Media's websites, even
                if MousePaw Media or a MousePaw Media authorized
                representative has been notified orally or in writing of
                the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions
                do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
                limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
                damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
            </p>

                The materials appearing on MousePaw Media's websites
                could include technical, typographical, or photographic

                materials on its websites are accurate, complete, or
                current. MousePaw Media may make changes to the materials
                contained on its websites at any time without notice.
                However MousePaw Media does not make any commitment to
                update the materials.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in
