                    We've opened our development server to the public, so you
                    can get involved in our open source projects! DevNet is home
                    to our repositories, bug tracker, wiki, building and testing
                    system, and many of our collaborative tools.

                    DevNet lives on Hawksnest, a server operated by MousePaw
                    Media. Hawksnest is typically available 7 days a week, from
                    7am-10pm Pacific (1400-0500 UTC). The server's
                    status will be published to this page.

                        Hawksnest is listed as ONLINE, but I can't access DevNet.
                        What's going on?
                    </p>
                    <div>
                    <p>
                        There are three common reasons for this:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Internet issues at our office. When this happens,
                            by time we can list the outage on our website,
                            the problem is resolved.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A server issue we haven't found out about yet.
                            You're welcome to report it to us.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you were using DevNet and suddenly
                            lost access, you likely triggered the server's
                            security systems. If you believe this was in
                            error, contact us for help regaining access.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why do you have server hours?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        There are several reasons, but a major one is that we
                        have a small team, and we don't want the logistical
                        annoyances of handling technical and security alerts
                        in the middle of the night.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm in another part of the world, so those server
                        hours are really hard to work around! Can you leave
                        the server up for me?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Sorry, only staff can request server hour extensions.
                        However, all things considered, you have 18 hours in
                        which to access DevNet.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        It's after hours, but the server is still up. What's
                        the deal?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        The server hours really just mean "it should be online
                        during this time." Sometimes we run the development
                        server outside of those hours as well.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why aren't you using [INSERT HOSTING SERVICE HERE]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We carefully considered a lot of options, factoring in
                        logistics, technical needs, maintenance, security, and
                        data storage. For what we're doing, we believe that
                        hosting DevNet on Hawksnest is the best option for us.

                        Uhm...why are there <em>My Little Pony</em> characters
                        as the profile pictures of most of the staff on
                        DevNet Phabricator?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Because it makes work 20% cooler! *Ahem* Actually, it's
                        an inside joke, turned April Fool's prank, turned
                        company tradition. Besides that, we like ponies.
