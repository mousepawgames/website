                    No, they're not yellow (unless you printed them on that
                    color paper.) The name refers to this project's history,
                    from Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald's college days.
                </p>
                <blockquote><p>
                    "Back when I was taking Pre-Calculus, I had a five subject
                    notebook I used for my class notes. I would write especially
                    important facts on the yellow divider pages, so I could find
                    them easily later. Since then, I have frequently referenced
                    those 'yellow sheets' while tutoring at our local community
                    college, often copying them down for the student for keep.""
                </p></blockquote>
                <p>
                    These Yellow Sheets are modeled after the charts Jason
                    successfully used in tutoring. Thus, the name refers to the
                    theory of content: these charts and graphs contain only that
                    information which you would write on a notebook divider page
                    in your class notes.

                <h2>Using Yellow Sheets</h2>
                <p>
                    These are intended to be learning tools. They are no
                    substitution for one-on-one explanations, lectures, reading
                    the textbook, or doing the work. Educators using Yellow
                    Sheets should consider working the example problem with the
                    student, explaining all the concepts contained therein.

                        Will you be adding more Yellow Sheets?

                    <div><p>
                        We hope so. However, since Jason left tutoring to
                        focus on other things, this project is on the
                        back burner.

                </div>

                        What's with that little stunt where you find the
                        asymptotes of the hyperbola? Isn't that cheating?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        I (Jason) learned that method from my college math
                        professor, Mary Jule Gabiou. She reportedly stumbled
                        across that method in her own experimentation, at the
                        request of some very confused students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some math purists dislike the method because they see it
                        as "cheating." I don't agree. Working out the asymptotes
                        the long way will always yield the exact same result as
                        the short way, with considerably more work, and thus
                        many more opportunities for mistakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should defer, however, to your professor's own view
                        on the topic; if the long way is required in homework
                        or tests, you should only use the shortcut to
                        cross-check your work. After you finish the class, you
                        can use the short way to get the right answer in a
                        reasonable time frame.
