                <h2>More Accurate Scoring.</h2>

                <p>
                    Trailcrest uses an original algorithm for more accurate
                    scoring. Unlike "raw percentage" scoring, which loses its
                    reliability the less questions there are, the Trailcrest
                    algorithm most closely represents the player's grasp of the
                    material.
                </p>
                <table>

                <h2>Intelligent Level Adjustment.</h2>

                <p>
                    As play progresses, Trailcrest automatically adjusts the
                    content difficulty to ensure the player is receiving the
                    best material for them. When it detects that content is too
                    hard, it will lower the level; when the player excels over
                    time, the level is raised. Level lockout ensures the content
                    is never too easy - when a player has proven mastery of a
                    level, it can only be accessed by a manual teacher override.

                <h2>Universal Save Files.</h2>

                <p>
                    Our entire <em>Operation SpyRat</em> series uses universal
                    save files. A player can create an agent profile in one
                    game, and use that same profile in all other games and grade
                    levels in the series. Common settings are applied globally,
                    and educators can access scores across multiple subjects and
                    grade levels with one click.

                <p>
                    Trailcrest can detect when a player is having extra trouble
                    with a concept, and will automatically provide help. We
                    don't mean the vague hints seen in many games. Animated
                    characters explain tough concepts in detail, while brief
                    tutorial animations ensure full understanding of all of the
                    game's activities.

                <p>
                    No computer is perfect, and none can read minds. With this
                    in mind, Trailcrest gives educators the ultimate control
                    over the game. Levels can be adjusted freely. Level
                    adjustment parameters, auto help features, word lists...all
                    of it is in the teacher's grasp. Changes can be applied to
                    specific students, and teacher controls are password
                    protected to prevent tampering.
