                    Games aren't all we create; in pursuing our main projects,
                    we create other tools and applications. Some are to make
                    our work easier, others are proofs-of-concept for technical
                    stuff.

                <h2>Old Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    You may be looking for a few of our old projects.
                    We pulled some previous Labs projects because, really, they
                    were just too rough and clunky to release to the world. One
                    is just a plugin that only a handful of people will be
                    looking for - that one can still be downloaded below.
                </p>
                <p class=center>

                </p>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <h3>PocketWatch</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This project was built for Adventure Maker, game
                            design platform we were experimenting with. We no
                            longer use either, and honestly, it just didn't rank
                            a project page of its own. Some people still use the
                            plugin, so you can still
                            <a href=/downloads/pocketwatchsetup.exe>Download</a>
                            the installer (Windows only).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PocketWatch allows for the execution of a timer of
                            any length, at the end of which, one or more events
                            occur. This offers an advantage over the built-in
                            timer, which only supports up to 60 seconds. The
                            GearSets feature allows for the use of up to five
                            independent timers. It is free to use, even in
                            commercial projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is unsupported, and will never be
                            updated. Actually, we seem to have lost the source
                            code.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Slannan</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Our old local-based bug tracker, Slannan, had some
                            serious bugs that we were never able to fix. It is
                            unique, and shows promise as a useful application,
                            but we want to rethink a few things. We'll be
                            revisiting the design of the software somewhere down
                            the line. In the meantime, the code can still be
                            found on
                            <a href=https://github.com/mousepawmedia/slannan target=_blank>GitHub</a>,
                            so you're welcome to run it from the Python source
                            if you're feeling adventurous.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <h3>TimeCard</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This was a very old time-tracker project built with
                            Microsoft Visual .NET framework. We will be
                            rebuilding the project on an open source platform at
                            some undefined point in the future. You might be
                            able to locate this one floating around the
                            internet, but we no longer support nor recommend it,
                            especially since we can't vouch for the safety of
                            any of the sites it is currently being served from.
                            (Actually, we already torched the source code.)
