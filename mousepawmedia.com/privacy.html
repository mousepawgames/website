            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                MousePaw Media believes strongly in the respect of visitors' and
                users' privacy. We have adopted this privacy policy to guide how
                MousePaw Media gathers, stores, and uses information from the
                use of MousePaw Media products and online sites by users.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy is current as of its last revision date. However,
                please note that this policy may be amended from time to time to
                reflect changes and additions to the privacy policy. Please
                check back for the most recent version before relying on any of
                the provisions in this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
                By using MousePaw Media's online sites and products, users agree
                that MousePaw Media may collect and aggregate information,
                individual information, and personally identifiable information,
                as defined below. MousePaw Media may share aggregate information
                and individual information with other parties. MousePaw Media
                shall not share personally identifiable information with other
                parties, except as described in the policy below.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Aggregate information" is information that describes the
                habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but
                does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Individual information" is information about a user that is
                presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to
                other users but not in a form that personally identifies any
                user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any
                user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such
                communication. This information may be used to improve MousePaw
                Media's products and online sites, for internal marketing
                studies, or simply to collect demographic information about
                MousePaw Media's users.
            </p>
            <p>
                MousePaw Media may use customer contact information provided by
                users to send information about MousePaw Media, including news
                about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional
                materials, but only if the users agree to receive such
                communications. Except in the cases describes below, MousePaw
                Media will not share personally identifiable information with
                any third party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in
                advance. "Personally identifiable information" consists of a
                user's name, email address, physical address, or other data
                about the user that enables the recipient to personally identify
                the user. While MousePaw Media collects personally identifiable
                information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and
                online sites, MousePaw Media's collection of personally
                identifiable information may be a requirement for access to the
                product or site. Personally identifiable information will be
                processed and stored by MousePaw Media in databases situated in
                the United States. MousePaw Media may allow third parties
                performing services under contract with MousePaw Media to access
                stored information but such access shall only be to the extent
                necessary to provide these services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally identifiable information protected under this privacy
                policy and collected from users may be done in conjunction with
                associates under agreement with MousePaw Media. If an associate
                of MousePaw Media is collecting such personally identifiable
                information within one of our products of online sites, MousePaw
                Media will make users aware of this at the time the information
                is gathered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, external websites and companies with links to and
                from MousePaw Media's online sites and products may collect
                personal information about users. MousePaw Media's privacy
                policy does not extend to these external websites and companies.
                Please refer directly to these companies and websites regarding
                their privacy policies.
            </p>

                subsequent email communications to users.
            </p>
            <h2>Storage and Security of Information</h2>
            <p>
                Personally identifiable information will be processed and stored
                by MousePaw Media in databases hosted in the United States.
