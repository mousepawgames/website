            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                MousePaw Media believes strongly in the respect of visitors'
                and users' privacy. We have adopted this privacy policy to
                guide how MousePaw Media gathers, stores, and uses information
                from the use of MousePaw Media products and online sites by
                users.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy is current as of its last revision date. However,
                please note that this policy may be amended from time to time
                to reflect changes and additions to the privacy policy. Please
                check back for the most recent version before relying on any
                of the provisions in this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
                We allow you to create accounts on some of our websites,
                either directly or through a GitHub OAuth account integration.
                Account creation and use may require some personal data.
                We store the following data as provided by you,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your email address,</li>
                <li>Your legal name,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We value your privacy, and will not disclose your personally
                identifiable information, except as required by law, with any
                third parties, unless you give us permission first. In most
                cases, this information is stored indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do assume that if you contribute any work to our project,
                you'd like credit. If you don't want your username associated
                with your contributions, please let us know at
                <span class=email>privacy@<span>null</span>mousepawmedia.com</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to publicly share information using our platform,
                including via your user profile, you are giving all other users
                the right to view that information. Our Privacy Policy doesn't
                cover that, and we really can't do anything about it. Please
                use caution!
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally identifiable information will be processed and
                stored by MousePaw Media in MySQL databases hosted in the
                United States by MousePaw Media and by Linode. We've taken
                reasonable steps to protect the information users share with
                us, as has our web hosting service.
            </p>
            <p>
                External websites and companies with links to and from our
                online sites and products may collect personal information
                about users. Our privacy policy does not extend to these
                external websites and companies. Please refer directly to
                these companies and websites regarding their privacy policies.
            </p>
