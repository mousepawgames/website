							Just in time for the start of the school year,
							MousePaw Games has unveiled a brand new resouce
							through MousePaw Labs: Yellow Sheets. These handy
							math reference sheets pack all the essential
							information for a topic onto a single color page.
							The big graphs and clear step-by-step instructors
							are designed to simplify some of the most elusive
							math concepts.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Jason C. McDonald, aside from his duties at MousePaw
							Games, also works as a tutor at his local community
							college. "A lot of this information actually came
							out of my own class notes. I've been copying these
							graphs and charts for my tutees by hand for over a year,
							and I finally decided to make a polished version and
							publish it through the Labs." The name "Yellow Sheets"
							actually comes from the fact that some of those notes
							came off of the yellow divider pages in the five subject
							notebooks he used in class. The name reflects the project
							philosophy - Yellow Sheets only contain the information
							that you would want to write on one of those divider pages.
						</p>

							licensed under them, we wanted to give back to the free
							information community."
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							There are currently four documents in the "Yellow Sheets"
							series, covering criitcal concepts from College Algebra
							and Pre-Calculus, with more planned in the future. Each
							document is available as a print-quality PDF, which you
							can
