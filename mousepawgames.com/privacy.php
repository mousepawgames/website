				<p class="txtHead1">Privacy Policy</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					MousePaw Media believes strongly in the respect of
					visitors' and users' privacy. We have adopted this
					privacy policy to guide how MousePaw Media gathers,
					stores, and uses information from the use of
					MousePaw Media products and online sites by users.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					This policy is current as of its last revision
					date. However, please note that this policy may
					be amended from time to time to reflect changes
					and additions to the privacy policy. Please check
					back for the most recent version before relying on
					any of the provisions in this privacy policy.
				</p>

				<p class="txtHead4">Collection and Use of Information</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					By using MousePaw Media's online sites and products,
					users agree that MousePaw Media may collect and
					aggregate information, individual information,
					and personally identifiable information, as
					defined below. MousePaw Media may share aggregate
					information and individual information with other
					parties. MousePaw Media shall not share personally
					identifiable information with other parties,
					except as described in the policy below.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					"Aggregate information" is information that
					describes the habits, usage patterns, and
					demographics of users as a group but does not
					describe or reveal the identity of any particular
					user.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					"Individual information" is information about a
					user that is presented in a form distinguishable
					from information relating to other users but not
					in a form that personally identifies any user or
					enables the recipient to communicate directly with
					any user unless agreed to by the user in advance
					of such communication. This information may be
					used to improve MousePaw Media's products and
					online sites, for internal marketing studies, or
					simply to collect demographic information about
					MousePaw Media's users.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					MousePaw Media may use customer contact information
					provided by users to send information about
					MousePaw Media, including news about product
					updates, contests, events, and other promotional
					materials, but only if the users agree to receive
					such communications. Except in the cases describes
					below, MousePaw Media will not share personally
					identifiable information with any third party
					unless the user agrees to such disclosure in
					advance. "Personally identifiable information"
					consists of a user's name, email address,
					physical address, or other data about the user
					that enables the recipient to personally identify
					the user. While MousePaw Media collects personally
					identifiable information on a voluntary basis,
					for certain products and online sites, MousePaw
					Media's collection of personally identifiable
					information may be a requirement for access to the
					product or site. Personally identifiable
					information will be processed and stored by MousePaw
					Media in databases situated in the United States.
					MousePaw Media may allow third parties performing
					services under contract with MousePaw Media to
					access stored information but such access shall
					only be to the extent necessary to provide these
					services.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Personally identifiable information protected
					under this privacy policy and collected from
					users may be done in conjunction with associates
					under agreement with MousePaw Media. If an
					associate of MousePaw Media is collecting such
					personally identifiable information within one
					of our products of online sites, MousePaw Media
					will make users aware of this at the time the
					information is gathered.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Furthermore, external websites and companies with
					links to and from MousePaw Media's online sites and
					products may collect personal information about
					users. MousePaw Media's privacy policy does not
					extend to these external websites and companies.
					Please refer directly to these companies and
					websites regarding their privacy policies.
				</p>

				<p class="txtHead4">Children Under the Age of 13</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					In compliance with the Child Online Privacy
					Protection Act, MousePaw Media will not knowingly
					collect personally identifiable information from
					any person age 12 and under. MousePaw Media
					encourages parents to instruct their children to
					never give out personal information when online.
					Parents who are concerned about the transfer of
					personal information from their children may
					contact us at

					on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically
					associated with websites. MousePaw Media may use
					cookies on their websites. MousePaw Media may also

					boards. Any information that is disclosed in these
					online communities is not necessarily regulated by
					MousePaw Media or covered under this privacy policy.
					Users should exercise caution when deciding to

					discontinuing receipt of promotional email
					communications from MousePaw Media. Instructions
					for discontinuing receipt of promotional email
					communications from MousePaw Media will be provided
