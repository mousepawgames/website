                        “Doing an internship with MousePaw Games
                        allowed me to learn new skills and put the
                        skills that I was learning into practice.
                        Because of the startup environment I was able
                        to explore different areas of interest,
                        I wasn't just writing code, I was working on
                        the graphical layout and the content as well.”

                        “This internship is a great chance to gain
                        some extra programming experience...when you

                        can work from wherever works best for you...
                        the hours and location make this a great
                        opportunity for those that would like some

                <p class="txtReg">
                    We like working with interns for two reasons: one,
                    because many are much more willing to learn and try
                    new things, and two, because they bring a lot of
                    out-of-the-box ideas to the company. We're blazing
                    a brand new trail. Experience can be
                    gained, but daring creativity is much harder to
                    come by. By and large, the only way into MousePaw
                    Games is through the internship program.

                <p class="txtReg">
                    MousePaw Games is a startup company. Since we are
                    working on our first product, no one is getting
                    paychecks just yet. However, we recognize that
                    your time and talent are valuable, and as such,
                    we believe that all interns are entitled to
                    compensation.

                <p class="txtReg">
                    Your time logged during the internship will be
                    credited to you as an investment in the company,
                    at the rate of $10 an hour as shares. Once we
                    launch, these shares will continue to pay dividends
                    to you for the life of the company.
                    We are not, and will never be, publicly traded,
                    so your investment is safe.

                    Additionally, upon completion of your internship,

                    the opportunity to build your career at MousePaw
