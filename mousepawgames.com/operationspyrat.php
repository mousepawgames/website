						<p class="txtHead2">Exciting Stories, Memorable Characters</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Operation SpyRat comes from the imaginations
							of some highly creative individuals.
							Following the motto: "if we don't think
							it's cool, they won't either," the MousePaw
							Games team has created an exciting and
							engaging adventure for all ages.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Fuzzy companions, global espionage, and
							numerous twists and turns make for a
							hilarious and rollicking quest to save the
							world.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Unforgettable Adventures</p>
						<img class="imgRight imgMedium" src="/img/characters/luke.png"/>
						<p class="txtReg">
							It shouldn't come as a surprise that Lead
							Developer Jason C. McDonald grew up on
							educational software. Coming from years of
							saying to himself, "I would have done that
							differently...", he and the rest of the
							MousePaw Games team work hard to create
							unique activities. Their goal is to make
							learning come naturally.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Forget game-like quizzes and recycled
							classic standbys. These activities are
							designed to promote experimentation and
							hands-on learning.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Top Notch Content</p>
						<img class="imgLeft imgMedium" src="/img/characters/annie.png"/>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Our team is very finicky about what goes
							in the final product. Operation SpyRat is
							built with studio-quality graphics and
							audio, innovative code, and comprehensive
							content. In our book, cutting corners is
							not an option! At MousePaw Games, we
							believe that quality is a major factor in
							engaging and retaining players' attentions.
							You can rest assured you'll be getting our
							absolute, fur-combed, armor-shined,
							feathers-preened best!
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Barrier-breaking Education</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Operation SpyRat seeks to go beyond
							traditional grade levels, dividing content
							instead into dozens of stages of
							proficiency. This means that our games
							can be used in public and private schools,
							by homeschooling families, as well as by
							students with learning disabilities,
							late learners, and ESL.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							The content and storyline is designed for
							enjoyment by all ages, so older players
							don't feel like they're stuck with a
							"kiddie game" just because they're
							working with earlier concepts.
						</p>

						<img class="imgRight imgMedium" src="/img/characters/ming.gif"/>
						<p class="txtHead2">Adventure For All!</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Many members of the MousePaw Games team
							know what it is like to live with various
							learning disabilities and special needs.
							Disappointed by the stunning lack of
							accessibility features in educational
							games, Jason McDonald and the rest of the
							team dedicated special attention to
							ensuring the game could be used by all
							sorts of learners.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							The interface is designed to be dyslexic
							and color-blind friendly. Language captions
							are provided for ESL players. Gameplay can
							be tailored for attention disorders. Content
							can be adjusted to meet the unique interests of
							Autism-spectrum learners.
						</p>
						<p class="txtHead2">Reliability and Compatibility</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Operation SpyRat engineered to work with
							most major operating systems, with superior
							backwards compatibility. Our game core is
							designed to make the most of limited system
							resources - great news for those school
							computer labs that rely on donated
							computers! Meanwhile, we are ensuring that
							many newer operating systems will still
							support our games.

								<p class="txtReg">
									We're still in development, so it isn't
									ready for public release yet. If you want
									to be among the first to play it, check
									out the <a href="/participate/testers">Testers Program</a>.

							<p class="txtReg"><b>
								What operating systems will you support?
							</b></p>
							<div class="hiddenDiv">
								<p class="txtReg">
									Many schools cannot afford to upgrade their
									computers, thus, we're doing our best to
									bring the game to them. We are aiming to
									support Windows 95 - Windows 7, Mac OS X,
									and all major variants of Linux.
									Yup, we're ambitious.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
							<p class="txtReg"><b>
								Wait..what about Windows 8 and 10?
							</b></p>
							<div class="hiddenDiv">
								<p class="txtReg">
									We've done a lot of research into the
									newest versions of Windows, and we've
									decided <i>not</i> to support them,
									for both technical and ethical reasons.
									We're not cool with Microsoft's controversial
									new Terms of Service (yes, we reviewed those
									personally), and we would have to go
									out of our way to get our software
									running on those operating systems.
									We strongly recommend upgrading to
									<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop" target=_blank>
										Ubuntu Linux
									</a>
									- its free, modern, and stable.
									Our entire company runs on it!

						<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
							<p class="txtReg"><b>
								How much will it cost?
							</b></p>
							<div class="hiddenDiv">
								<p class="txtReg">
									We haven't finalized prices (obviously),
									but we're looking at charging $25
									one-time for a home license, and
									$200/year per classroom. Significant
									discounts will also be available.
									We believe that educational
									software should be affordable!

						<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
							<p class="txtReg"><b>
								Will this be an online game?
							</b></p>
							<div class="hiddenDiv">
								<p class="txtReg">
									No. Operation SpyRat will be installed from a
									CD-ROM, as many schools and individuals do not
									have access to high-speed internet. However,
									activation will most likely require an internet
									connection, even if it's dial-up.

								When will the game be available?

									We do not have any set release dates as of yet,

									We'll be updating our website and social media
									channels when we have something more concrete!
