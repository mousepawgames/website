							<p class="txtHead2">Jason C. McDonald</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Chief Executive Officer, Lead Developer</p>
							<img class="staffphotoRight" width="200px" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/staff/JasonMcDonald.png"/>
							<p class="txtReg">Operation SpyRat originally came from Jason C. McDonald's imagination – it first took the form of a free web game on his (now defunct) website, KidMagine.com. Jason heads up the programming department, with eight computer languages under his belt, and, he claims, "enough knowledge about several others to get into trouble." He is the author of Ratscript, the company's in-house scripting language.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">A TBI survivor, Jason is acutely aware of life with a learning disability, yet he doesn't let his disability slow him down. In addition to his role in the company, he mentors young programmers, speaks on the topic of software development, and tutors math and computer science at the local community college.</p>

He first got into computers after a course at his high school, and started getting ideas from his friends on what to build. The son of a preschool teacher, he enjoys working with kids, so it is no surprise that he now helps build children's educational software.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">In high school, Michael served as team captain and competed at the regional level in wresting, and took fourth at state with his soccer team. Michael loves playing role-playing and multiplayer video games, yet he enjoys any excuse to get out into nature, especially backpacking.</p>
