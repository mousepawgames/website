						<p class="txtReg">
							On April 25th, Stacy Carlson became the first official
							graduate of the MousePaw Games internship program. Stacy
							joined the company in April 2014 to help design and build
							the activities for Operation SpyRat: Word4Word.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							“She is incredibly imaginative,” said Anne McDonald, Lead
							Content Developer. “She came up with some excellent and
							fun activity designs, which we will be incorporating.”
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							About halfway through Stacy's internship, the company was
							forced to drop Adobe Flash, making Carlson's prototypes
							obsolete, even though the designs remained strong. Carlson
							then switched gears, helping to build the replacement
							animation platform, Lightrift, based on another open source
							project. The programming language being used was unfamiliar
							to her at the time, but Carlson persisted.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							“The running joke was that the project was paramount to
							learning Spanish by being dropped off in the middle of
							Mexico,” Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald recounted.
							Nevertheless, Carlson and the team pulled through, finding
							the causes of performance issues in the original project,
							and designing a new graphics engine to solve those problems.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							When asked about her experience with the internship program,
							Carlson replied, “Doing an internship with MousePaw Games
							allowed me to learn new skills and put the skills that I was
							learning into practice. Because of the startup environment
							I was able to explore different areas of interest, I wasn't
							just writing code, I was working on the graphical layout
							and the content as well.”
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Stacy Carlson's role with MousePaw Games continues under her
							new title of Senior UI Designer, designing the user interface
							for Lightrift. Meanwhile, she is also seeking paying employment
							elsewhere. “All the interviewers ask me about the internship,”
							she says.
						</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							The staff at MousePaw Games look forward to a long and
							adventurous relationship with Carlson.
