								<i>Infiltrator</i> is an alternative reality game [ARG] that
								transforms your party guests into secret agents. Trade codes
								with the other players, and try to collect the most. There's
								a catch, however: one of the agents is the infiltrator,
								and if you enter a code from them, you're out of the game!
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								Can someone correctly identify the double agent, or will
								the infiltrator be the last one standing?

							<p class="txtReg">
								The computer randomly generates the entire game from your
								guest list, and provides the control panel for every agent
								to redeem codes, deploy high-tech tricks, and make accusations.
								One computer is all you need to run the entire game.
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								The real game play happens <i>off</i> the computer, in the
								environment of your party. In order to win, players have to
								be subtle and observant.
							</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">Find Your Team</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								<i>Infiltrator</i> randomly assigns teams, and it is up
								to players to find and connect with their fellow agents.
								Team members can work together to advance in the game and
								pinpoint the infiltrator - but beware! One of your teammates
								might just be the double agent you're seeking.

							<p class="txtHead2">Tricks and Tactics</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								<i>Infiltrator</i>'s game interface makes a few sneaky
								tricks possible. If you time it right, you can secretly
								intercept a code from another agent. You can go incognito
								and pretend to be "out".
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								Meanwhile, the infiltrator can connect
								with his or her team members without decommissioning them, and
								then take them out with a button click. The entire game is designed
								to keep your guests guessing, and second-guessing, their
								conclusions about the infiltrator's identity!
							</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">Room For Creativity</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								The gameplay is designed so that <i>Infiltrator</i> can go on in
								the background of the party, during dinner, or while other games
								are being played. This makes it perfect for gatherings of all sorts.
								It was, in fact, created for MousePaw Games' own company events.
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								You can even design your party around <i>Infiltrator</i> if you so
								desire, awarding prizes to the winners. It's a fast and easy alternative
								to murder mystery parties. Just add guests and a fun environment!
