							<p class="txtHead1">Anari: Vector Animation Reimagined</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Anari is MousePaw Games' original animation engine, which is designed to deliver high-performance vector animations and interactivity tools.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Powerful and Complete.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Anari is designed to handle SVG format graphics, so your existing graphics can be transferred over to Anari for display and animation.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Memory Conscious Design.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Many animation platforms make considerable demands on computer hardware. Anari is built from the ground up to optimize memory wherever possible.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Bridge the Gap.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Certain popular commercial animation platforms have been forcing their users to switch to HTML5, a format ill-suited to many software projects. Anari uses Gtk+3 and Cairo to provide application-level graphics support, for everyone who wants to build software, not websites in disguise.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead2">When will Lightrift be available?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Anari is presently in development, with no set release date. You can find out how get involved in the project <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/opensource">here.</a></p>
							<p class="txtHead2">What about Synfig Studio?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">After discussions with developers on that team, we all concluded that game animation required a different engine. We still plan to collaborate with Synfig Studio. (See <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/projects/lightrift">Lightrift</a> for more info.)</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Is Anari open-source?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Yes it is! We want to provide a powerful alternative to proprietary animation platforms, and we believe that open source is the way to do it. Besides, it lets us coordinate with our friends at the Synfig Studio project.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">So Anari is free?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Yes...and no. It is licensed under the GPLv3, so if you're okay keeping your own code open-source, Anari is free forever. If you want to use in a closed-source project, you'll have to pay us. (Prices TBD.)</p>
