						<p class="txtHead1">Succeed with Trailcrest!</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Trailcrest is the innovative game core that
							serves as the foundation to all our games.
							It is specifically designed to overcome
							some of the most common problems with
							educational software.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">More Accurate Scoring</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Trailcrest uses an original algorithm for
							more accurate scoring. Unlike "raw
							percentage" scoring, which loses its
							reliability the less questions there are,
							the Trailcrest algorithm most closely
							represents the player's grasp of the
							material.

						<p class="txtHead2">Intelligent Level Adjustment</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							As play progresses, Trailcrest automatically
							adjusts the content difficulty to ensure
							the player is receiving the best material
							for them. When it detects that content is
							too hard, it will lower the level; when the
							player excels over time, the level is
							raised. Level lockout ensures the content
							is never too easy - when a player has
							proven mastery of a level, it can only be
							accessed by a manual teacher override.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Customized Content</p>
						<img class="imgFramedLeft" src="/img/photos/dictionary.png" alt="Magnifying glass on a dictionary." width=300px/>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Trailcrest doesn't just manage broad concept
							levels. Our state-of-the-art content
							engine is designed to tailor material to
							meet each player's unique needs and
							capabilities. It tracks progress down to
							each individual word, and uses that
							information to intelligently select content
							from our massive database.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Universal Save Files</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Our entire Operation SpyRat series uses
							universal save files. A player can create
							an agent profile in one game, and use that
							same profile in all other games and grade
							levels in the series. Common settings are
							applied globally, and educators can access
							scores across multiple subjects and grade
							levels with one click.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Automated Help System</p>
						<img class="imgFramedRight" src="/img/photos/mistake.png" alt="Paper with a writing mistake crossed out." width=300px/>
						<p class="txtReg">
							Trailcrest can detect when a player is
							having extra trouble with a concept, and
							will automatically provide help. We don't
							mean the vague hints seen in many games.
							Animated characters explain tough concepts
							in detail, while brief tutorial animations
							ensure full understanding of all of the
							game's activities.
						</p>

						<p class="txtHead2">Complete Teacher Control</p>
						<p class="txtReg">
							No computer is perfect, and none can read
							minds. With this in mind, Trailcrest gives
							educators the ultimate control over the
							game. Levels can be adjusted freely. Level
							adjustment parameters, auto help features,
							word lists...all of it is in the teacher's
							grasp. Changes can be applied to specific
							students, and teacher controls are password
							protected to prevent tampering.
