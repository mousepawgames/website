				<p class="txtHead1">About the Company</p>
				<p class="txtReg">MousePaw Games was founded in 2010 by Jason C. McDonald. In 2009, he had built a free web game, Remmie and the Lab Rats, which appeared on his now-closed children's website KidMagine.com. While the website's low traffic didn't afford Lab Rats much exposure, it was met with rave reviews from its audience.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">After a year of planning and experimentation, he asked freelance editor and author Anne McDonald to join the project as Lead Content Developer, and later, Chief Operations Officer.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">With the help of some very creative friends, the team had completed Word4Word ALPHA 1, the first fully-playable prototype of the game, which was also Jason's senior project.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">Starting in 2013, MousePaw Games expanded its team, starting the <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/internships">internship program</a>, which offers a year-long compensated internship to college students and recent graduates, fast-tracking their entry into game design and software development fields.</p>
				<p class="txtReg">MousePaw Games is dedicated to filling a large gap in the software market, providing high-quality educational games for both the classroom and the living room. In addition to their main projects, MousePaw Games seeks to further education at all levels through free educational resources, and through supporting and contributing to the open-source movement.</p>

				<p class="txtHead1">Code of Ethics</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					MousePaw Games is dedicated to encouraging 
					learning and creativity in people of all ages, 
					especially children. Our ethical principles are 
					intended to guide our actions and decisions 
					towards this goal.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					While commercial and financial success is desirable, 
					it is not to be pursued to the detriment of the 
					company’s ethics. The company should place PEOPLE 
					OVER PROFIT, seeking the well-being of its 
					customers and employees first and foremost.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					There is never a reason to cut corners, and 
					“good enough” is never good enough. Employees 
					and managers should be diligent in pursuit of 
					QUALITY, taking the extra time and effort to 
					create a polished, high quality product worthy 
					of our customers.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Mistakes are a natural part of growth. Each 
					individual in the company should be HONEST 
					about and WILLING TO LEARN from these mistakes. 
					There is never a good reason to excuse and cover 
					up mistakes. Each individual should also 
					continually seek to expand his or her abilities 
					and knowledge in their relevant field(s).
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Good COMMUNICATION is vital to a 
					team’s success, and the company should make every 
					effort to foster and promote natural and healthy 
					communication between employees, managers, and as 
					appropriate, customers. Managers should be diligent 
					in ensuring that company policies do not inhibit 
					collaboration and the free and open exchange of 
					ideas within the company, within reason.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Employees and representatives of the company 
					should exhibit RESPECT and WISDOM in their words 
					and deeds, being mindful and sensitive to others 
					viewpoints, ideas, and opinions, and taking into 
					consideration the possible repercussions of their 
					words and actions.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					HONESTY and FAIRNESS should be present in all of 
					the company’s policies and actions, never 
					deliberately misleading, manipulating, or 
					discriminatory. It should seek outcomes that are 
					just and evenhanded for all parties involved.
				</p>
				<p class="txtReg">
					Each individual in the company should take 
					RESPONSIBILITY for his or her words, actions, 
					and work, and the company should take 
					responsibility for its representatives.
