							<p class="txtHead2">Exciting Stories, Memorable Characters</p>
							<img class="characterLeft" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/characters/blueclaw.gif" width=130px/>
							<p class="txtReg">Operation SpyRat comes from the imaginations of some highly creative individuals. Following the motto: "if we don't think it's cool, they won't either," the MousePaw Games team has created an exciting and engaging adventure for all ages.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Fuzzy companions, global espionage, and numerous twists and turns make for a hilarious and rollicking quest to save the world.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Unforgettable Adventures</p>
							<img class="characterRight" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/characters/luke.png" width=150px/>
							<p class="txtReg">It shouldn't come as a surprise that Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald grew up on educational software. Coming from years of saying to himself, "I would have done that differently...", he and the rest of the MousePaw Games team work hard to create unique activities. Their goal is to make learning come naturally.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Forget game-like quizzes and recycled classic standbys. These activities are designed to promote experimentation and hands-on learning.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Top Notch Content</p>
							<img class="characterLeft" src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/characters/annie.png" width=150px/>
							<p class="txtReg">Our team is very finicky about what goes in the final product. Operation SpyRat is built with studio-quality graphics and audio, innovative code, and comprehensive content. In our book, cutting corners is not an option! At MousePaw Games, we believe that quality is a major factor in engaging and retaining players' attentions. You can rest assured you'll be getting our absolute, fur-combed, armor-shined, feathers-preened best!</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">Barrier-breaking Education</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Operation SpyRat seeks to go beyond traditional grade levels, dividing content instead into three stages of proficiency. This means that our games can be used, not only in elementary schools, but by students with learning disabilities, late learners, and ESL.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">The content and storyline is designed for enjoyment by all ages, so older players don't feel like they're stuck with a "kiddie game" just because they're working with earlier concepts.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Adventure For All!</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Many members of the MousePaw Games team know what it is like to live with various learning disabilities and special needs. Disappointed by the stunning lack of accessibility features in educational games, Jason McDonald and the rest of the team dedicated special attention to ensuring the game could be used by all sorts of learners.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">The interface is designed to be dyslexic and color-blind friendly. Closed captions are provided for hearing impaired. Gameplay can be tailored for attention disorders. Content can be adjusted to meet the unique interests of Autism-spectrum learners.</p>
							<p class="txtHead2">Reliability and Compatibility</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Operation SpyRat engineered to work with most major operating systems, with superior backwards compatibility. Our game core is designed to make the most of limited system resources - great news for those school computer labs that rely on donated computers! Meanwhile, we are ensure that many newer operating systems will still support our games.</p>
