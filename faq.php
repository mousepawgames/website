					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						What makes you different from
						{INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE}?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						A lot of companies are build around the
						traditional concept of profit. MousePaw
						Games wants to give learners of all ages
						and abilities the tools they need to
						succeed. We exist for them, not the
						other way around.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Can I work for you?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						At this time, we only offer internships.
						You can find more details
						<a href="/participate/internships">here.</a>
						</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Can I volunteer to help build the game
						engine?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						That would be awesome! We'd love to have your
						help. Check out our
						<a href="/opensource" target=_blank>
							Open Source information page
						</a> to learn how to get involved.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						I'm a teacher/parent. Is there any way I can
						get early access to the game?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Yes! Once we have something distributable, we
						will be needing volunteers to test out the game
						and give us feedback. The program is free, and
						has some really snazzy benefits. Find out more
						on the <a href="/testers">
							Testers information page
						</a>.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Can I donate?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Yes, very soon! Once we feel <i>Operation SpyRat</i>
						is ready to go live, we'll be launching a
						Kickstarter. Meanwhile, the best way to
						support us is to follow us on social media,
						and to spread the word!
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						If you just can't wait, please consider
						donating to the
						<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target=_blank>
							Open Source Initiative
						</a>,
						or our friends at
						<a href="http://www.synfig.org/cms/" target=_blank>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Can I invest?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						We have a very unusual business structure
						that is not the least bit appealing to
						investors in the traditional sense. We
						planned it that way. If you're really super
						serious, you are welcome to
						<a href="/connect" target=_blank>
							contact us
						</a> for more details.
					</p></div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						What's taking so long?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
							Short answer: We're dealing with the quality
							triangle: we can make it fast, cheap, or
							top-notch, pick two. For us, high quality
							is everything, and it has to be affordable
							for schools.
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						Long answer: Read
						<a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/" target=_blank>
							"Dreaming in Code" by Scott Rosenberg
						</a>
						to understand exactly why software projects
						have such funky moving deadlines.

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Do you support women and minorities in tech?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Absolutely! We are proud to have a good
						mix of women and men with diverse backgrounds
						and heritages on
						<a href="/team" target=_blank>our team</a>.
						While we're on the
						subject, we are certain to strictly	enforce
						"equal compensation for equal jobs". Anything
						less would be <i>totally</i> stone age thinking.

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						I have a game idea for you.
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Well, we're glad you thought of us, but
						we're up to our ears in ideas at the moment.
						Why not start your own company, so we can
						cheer you on?

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Are you targeting mobile platforms with your
						games?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Nope. The average lifespan of a tablet computer
						is less than two years in the hands of a
						responsible adult. That's a frightning statistic
						when you think about schools buying tablets
						for their students. We don't want to contribute
						to this problematic trend. Maintaining a
						Linux-driven school computer lab costs
						significantly less any way you look at it, so
						we'd rather encourage that.
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						As to personal mobile devices, that market is
						totally saturated with millions of games. We
						always <i>did</i> prefer the road not taken.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Isn't targeting Linux kinda...risky?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Linux is free, safe, easy to use, and can
						be used to revitalize even a fifteen-year-old
						computer. It's a perfect match for the millions
						of computer users who can't afford The Latest
						Trendy Computer every year.
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						We know Linux isn't perfect for everyone,
						so we still plan to support Windows and Mac,
						with a special focus on those "outdated"
						versions that so many people still rely on.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Did I hear that you're not supporting Windows 8
						and 10?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						Actually, we're <i>anti-supporting</i> every
						version of Windows 8 and later. The main reason
						is the debacle over the Terms of Service, which
						does indeed open the door to a full-blown privacy
						and security breach for every single user. Yes,
						we read through that entire contract, and we
						want nothing to do with that ticking time bomb.
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						If you think about it, the idea of anti-supporting
						an operating system isn't new. Big software giants
						have been anti-supporting Linux for years, when
						making their software work on that operating
						system would often take all of three days work.
						We're just using the move to support freedom in
						computing.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						Why aren't you using [major game engine]?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						There are a lot of awesome game engines out
						there, which have been used to make thousands
						of totally epic games. Our vision for
						<i>Operation SpyRat</i> is a little different,
						both in design and in its support of older
						machines. We believe that building our own
						game engine will allow us to accomplish those
						goals, while providing one more quality platform
						to game developers everywhere.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander" tabindex=-1>
					<p class="txtReg"><b>
						I'm a game developer, and I want to use your
						game engine, but I can't figure out how to
						get started. Can you help?
					</b></p>
					<div class="hiddenDiv"><p class="txtReg">
						The game engine has a long way to go before
						it's done. You can subscribe to our
						<a href="/out/enews" target=_blank>
							PawNews mailing list
						</a>
						to be notified when it's ready. You can also
						help speed things along by
						<a href="/opensource" target=_blank>
							volunteering on the open source project
						</a>.
