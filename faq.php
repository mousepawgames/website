							<p class="txtHead2">About the Game</p>
							<p class="txtHead3">What technologies do you use?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Operation SpyRat is build using an original game engine written in C++. The animation and graphics are built using Synfig Studio, which we are now helping to develop. <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/company/technologies">Read more about our technologies.</a></p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">Where can I play Operation SpyRat?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">We're still in development, so it isn't ready for public release yet. If you want to be among the first to play it, check out the <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/alpha">ALPHA</a> or <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/beta">BETA</a> programs.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">What operating systems will you support?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Many schools cannot afford to upgrade their computers, thus, we're doing our best to bring the game to them. At present, we will support Windows XP and later, Mac OSX, as well as Debian and RPM Linux. We acutally hope to support systems even older than that. Yup, we're ambitious.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">How much will it cost?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">We haven't finalized prices (obviously), but we're looking at charging $200/year per classroom (significant discounts will be available), and $25 one-time for a home license.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">Will this be an online game?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">No. Operation SpyRat will be installed from a CD-ROM, as many schools and individuals do not have access to high-speed internet. However, activation will most likely require an internet connection, even if it's dial-up.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">When will the game be available?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">We do not have any set release dates as of yet, as we're still early in the development process. We'll be updating our website and social media channels when we have something more concrete!</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Meanwhile, we will have a rather impressive free resource available for teachers sometime this winter (2014/2015).</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">About the Company</p>
							<p class="txtHead3">What makes you different from {INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE}?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">A lot of companies are build around the traditional concept of profit. MousePaw Games wants to give learners of all ages and abilities the tools they need to succeed. We exist for them, not the other way around.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">Can I work for you?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">At this time, we only offer internships. You can find more details <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/getinvolved/internships">here.</a></p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">Can I invest?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Short answer, no. We have a very unusual business structure that is not the least bit appealing to investors. We planned it that way. However, if you want to help us financially...</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">Can I donate?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Yes, very soon! Once we feel Operation SpyRat is ready to go live, we'll be launching a Kickstarter. Meanwhile, the best way to support us is to follow us on social media, and to spread the word!</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">I want to donate now!</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Hey, that's awesome! The best way to support us at the moment is to donate to our friends at <a href="http://www.synfig.org/cms/" target=_blank>Synfig Studio</a>.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">What's taking so long?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Short answer: We're dealing with the quality triangle: we can make it fast, cheap, or top-notch, pick two. For us, high quality is everything, and it has to be affordable for schools.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Long answer: Read <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/" target=_blank>"Dreaming in Code" by Scott Rosenberg</a> to understand exactly why software projects have such funky moving deadlines.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p class="txtHead3">I have an idea for you.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Well, we're glad you thought of us, but we're up to our ears in ideas at the moment. Why not start your own company, so we can cheer you on?</p>
