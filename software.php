				We imagine a world where educational software
				empowers learners of all ages and abilties to
				achieve their top potential, and to push the
				limits of human knowledge. Our flagship game,
				<i>Operation SpyRat</i>, aims to accomplish
				that goal and change how people look at
				educational software.
			</p>
			<p class="txtHead3">
				Everything we do at MousePaw Games is centered
				around that goal, but we have a lot of work ahead
				of us - so why not have some fun with it? We make
				tools to speed up our work, and other games to
				test out the techniques needed for
				our big project (and just for fun!)

			<p class="txtReg">
				You may be looking for a few of our old projects. We
				pulled some previous Labs projects because, really,
				they were just too rough and clunky to release to the
				world. One is just a plugin that only a handful of
				people will be looking for - that one can still
				be downloaded below.

				<p class="txtHead3">PocketWatch</p>
				<div class="hiddenDiv txtReg">
					<p class="txtReg">
						This project was built for Adventure Maker,
						game design platform we were experimenting with.
						We no longer use either, and honestly, it
						just didn't rank a project page of its own.
						Some people still use the plugin, so you can
						still
						<a href="/downloads/pocketwatchsetup.exe" target=_blank>Download</a>
						the installer (Windows only).
					</p>
					<p class="txtReg">
						PocketWatch allows for the execution of a timer
						of any length, at the end of which, one or more
						events occur. This offers an advantage over the
						built-in timer, which only supports up to 60
						seconds. The GearSets feature allows for the
						use of up to five independent timers. It is
						free to use, even in commercial projects.

				<div class="hiddenDiv txtReg">
					<p class="txtReg">
						Our old local-based bug tracker, Slannan,
						had some serious bugs that we were never able
						to fix. It is unique, and shows promise as a
						useful application, but we want to rethink a
						few things. We'll be revisiting the design of
						the software somewhere down the line.
						In the meantime, the code can still be found
						on <a href="https://github.com/mousepawgames/slannan" target=_blank>Github</a>,
						so you're welcome to run it from the Python
						source if you're feeling adventurous.

					<p class="txtReg">
						This was a very old time-tracker project built
						with Microsoft Visual .NET framework. We will
						be rebuilding the project on an open source
						platform at some undefined point in the future.
						You might be able to locate this one floating
						around the internet, but we no longer support
						nor recommend it, especially since we can't
						vouch for the safety of any of the sites
						it is currently being served from. (Actually,
						we already torched the source code.)
