				<p class="txtReg">Experimentation come with the territory when you're creating top-notch games. That's why we created MousePaw Labs! Our development team is continually trying new things out in an effort to improve our software...and we get some pretty neat stuff as a result. Instead of hiding it away, we offer these little side projects to you absolutely free of charge!</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">DiamondQuest</p></a>
							<p class="txtReg">DiamondQuest is built in the tradition of command-line games like Nethack. In this, you answer math problems to dig down, and you find various buried treasures. Can you beat your high score? This game was built by Jason McDonald for a very special friend, but you can enjoy it too! [Win/Linux, Mac coming soon]</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">Redstring 2.0</p></a>
							<p class="txtReg">Creating a game requires a lot of repetitive typing, whether it be code or activity content. To save time, Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald created Redstring, short for "redundant text string generator." Redstring generates all possible combinations of text entered into a maximum of eight columns, using custom substitution models. [Win/Mac/Linux]</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">Slannan</p></a>
							<p class="txtReg">Slannan was created out of a company need - a local-based bug tracker. After reading <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/" target=_blank>Dreaming In Code by Scott Rosenberg</a>, Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald realized that a major problem with most bug trackers was that they effectively distinguish between minor and severe bugs, thus resulting in unfocused work by programmers. He designed a severity scale, the Heston Score, to distinguish bug severity. Slannan 1.0 is the first bug tracker to use this. While it is a rough version, this open-source project is very useful for small-scale programming projects. [Win/Mac/Linux]</p>

							<p class="txtHead2">TimeCard 1.0</p></a>
							<p class="txtReg">Early in game production, while the team was still putting prospective platforms through their paces, Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald decided to cut his teeth on the Visual Basic .NET platform by creating a time tracking application. TimeCard has been used by the company since. While this first version has a few rough edges, this being the first application built by MousePaw Games on the .NET platform, it is quite useful for keeping track of time. [Windows]</p>
							<p class="txtFooter">(Win/Mac Version 2.0 coming soon.)</p>
							<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target=_blank><p class="txtHead2">Requires Microsoft .NET 4</p></a>

							<img src="http://www.mousepawgames.com/img/labs/pocketwatch.gif" height=100px/>
							<p class="txtHead2">PocketWatch Plugin</p></a>
							<p class="txtReg">Originally, MousePaw Games considered a game platform called <a href="http://www.adventuremaker.com/" target_blank>AdventureMaker</a>. This platform was dropped shortly into the project, but not before Jason C. McDonald had created a VBScript plugin for the platform, to solve a need he had. This was actually his first piece of working software. PocketWatch allows for the execution of a timer of any length, at the end of which, one or more events occur. This offers an advantage over the built-in timer, which only supports up to 60 seconds. The GearSets feature allows for the use of up to five independent timers. It is free to use, even in commercial projects.</p>
