								Due to a disturbing drop in so-called "organic
								reach" on Facebook, CEO Jason C. McDonald made
								the call for the company to leave the social
								network.
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								The organic reach, which is the number of people
								who see a given post, averages around eight to
								ten people without interaction. Even at its peak,
								organic reach is still well under the total number
								of people who have liked MousePaw Games on Facebook.
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								"I've been reading a lot of PR from Facebook about how
								they're not messing with the organic reach, but the
								numbers don't match," reported McDonald. "I just quit
								Facebook personally, due to the fact that nearly
								everything in my news feed seemed to be paid promotion,
								and little if anything came from the people and
								pages I wanted to see the content from. We're
								not paying for social media reach. With an average
								lifespan of a couple of days on a post anyhow, it
								doesn't make any business sense."
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								Some may wonder: what about the other social media
								sites? "We have no plans to shut down anything else,"
								McDonald replies. "Twitter, for example, is proving
								itself to be an excellent platform. We're getting
								favorites and retweets from people and businesses
								around the world, most of which we've never heard of."
							</p>
							<p class="txtReg">
								MousePaw Games will be shutting down the Facebook page
								on Monday, September 15, 2014. Fans are encouraged to
								follow the company on its other social media channels.
