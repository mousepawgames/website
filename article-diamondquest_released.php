							<p class="txtReg">Yes, you read that right - a FREE GAME from MousePaw Games. (I told you we made those.)</p>
							<p class="txtReg">DiamondQuest is a command-line game in the style of games like Nethack. In this, you solve math problems to dig down and find treasures. You never know what you're going to find! Can you beat your highscore?</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Featuring retro ASCII art from Joan G Stark and others, and a simple command-line interface, DiamondQuest is a great way to brush up on adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing positive and negative numbers!</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Jason C. McDonald built DiamondQuest for a very special friend, but you can get in on the fun right now, too! Download for Windows or Linux at <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/labs/software">MousePaw Labs.</a> DiamondQuest is GPL licensed, meaning it is absolutely free forever!</p>
