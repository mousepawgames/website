							<p class="txtHead1">The New Website is Here!</p>
							<p class="txtSmall">07/27/2014</p>
							<p class="txtReg">We've just unveiled our renovated website, build by Lead Developer Jason C. McDonald, who is also a freelance webmaster.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">"This entire thing started because we wanted to make over the staff page," explained McDonald. "We have some really incredible people here, and we wanted to give them the kudos they deserve. We figured, while we were at it, we might as well renovate the whole thing."</p>
							<p class="txtReg">The new website also corresponds with exciting forward progress on the company's flagship product, Operation SpyRat. Not least of this is the new character designs. While we're using the old designs in the moment, new Lead Graphics Designer James Duram is hard at work redesigning the fuzzy crew of Operation SpyRat.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">Meanwhile, Anne McDonald is working to complete the extensive graphics library that will appear in Word4Word. It consists of thousands of high-resolution photographs, many of which are licensed under Creative Commons. It will be released by MousePaw Labs sometime this fall as a free (besides shipping) DVD-ROM.</p>
							<p class="txtReg">We hope you enjoy the new website. Please <a href="http://www.mousepawgames.com/follow">follow us</a> on social media to get all the latest news from MousePaw Games.</p>
