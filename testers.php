				Can't wait for <i>Operation SpyRat</i>? Want to be
				the first to play the latest adventure? We are looking
				families and educators to help us make <i>Operation
				SpyRat</i> the best that it can be.
			</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				The Testers Program is a fun and free way to get first
				access to the latest <i>Operation SpyRat</i> games.
				There are no tricks, no surprise fees, and no hidden
				obligations. Simply apply to the Test Track you're
				interested in, play the game, and give us your feedback.
			</p>

			<p class="txtHead2">BETA Track</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				As a tester on the <b>BETA Track</b>, you will get to
				play the full game before anyone else. BETA means that
				the game is complete, but may have some undiscovered
				glitches, errors, and omissions. Your feedback helps
				us find these problems and fix them, so the finished
				version is top quality.
			</p>

			<p class="txtHead2">ALPHA Track</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				The <b>ALPHA Track</b> gives you first access to the
				game <i>as we build it</i>! Try out individual activites
				and sectors, and give us your feedback. Because the
				software is early in the development process, user
				feedback has a singificant impact on the finished
				product.
			</p>
			<p class="txtReg">
				The whole purpose of ALPHA testing is to find these
				problems, so they can be resolved. In addition, since
				the software is early in the development process, user
				feedback has a significant impact on the finished
				product.
			</p>
